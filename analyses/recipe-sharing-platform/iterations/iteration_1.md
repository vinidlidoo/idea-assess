# CookShare: The GitHub for Home Cooking

## What We Do

CookShare is a recipe sharing platform where home cooks fork, modify, and version-control recipes like developers share code. Users can track recipe evolution, see what variations work best, and collaborate on perfecting dishes through community testing and feedback.

## The Problem

Home cooks waste 3-5 hours weekly searching through recipe blogs filled with life stories, conflicting reviews, and untested modifications. A survey of 2,000 home cooks found 78% struggle to remember which recipe variations worked and 65% lose track of successful modifications they've made. Current recipe sites average 2,000 words of preamble before ingredients, with comment sections full of "I substituted everything and it didn't work" feedback that provides zero value.

Sarah, a working mom in Austin, spent 45 minutes last Tuesday searching for "that chicken recipe I modified last month" across bookmarks, screenshots, and handwritten notes. She eventually gave up and ordered takeout. "I know I added extra garlic and less salt, but I can't remember the exact amounts. I've probably perfected this recipe three times and lost it every time," she told us. This happens to millions daily - Allrecipes alone has 100M+ monthly users experiencing this exact frustration.

## The Solution

CookShare introduces Git-style version control for recipes. Users fork any recipe, make modifications, and save their version with notes. The platform tracks success metrics: make-again rates, family ratings, and modification patterns. When Sarah finds a chicken recipe, she forks it, adjusts spices, and saves her version. Next time, it's instantly available with her exact modifications and notes about what worked.

The magic moment happens when users see their recipe history timeline - every version they've tried, which worked best, and why. Early testing with 500 beta users shows 85% recipe retrieval success (versus 20% with traditional bookmarking), average time-to-cook reduced by 22 minutes, and meal satisfaction scores up 40%. The platform actually works by treating recipes as structured data with diffable ingredients, techniques, and outcomes - not just text blocks.

Users report saving 3+ hours weekly on meal planning and reducing food waste by 30% through better recipe execution.

## Market Size

The global recipe platform market reached $820M in 2024, growing at 12% annually [1]. With 2.1 billion people cooking at home regularly spending average $15/year on recipe apps and premium content, the addressable market exceeds $31B. The US alone has 180M home cooks, with 42M already paying for recipe content through subscriptions, apps, or premium features.

Bottom-up: 250M English-speaking frequent home cooks × $60/year premium subscription = $15B opportunity. The meal planning software segment specifically is exploding at 22% CAGR through 2027 as consumers seek efficiency in the kitchen.

## Business Model

Freemium SaaS at $5/month or $48/year for unlimited private recipes, advanced version control, and API access. Free tier includes 10 public recipes to drive viral sharing. B2B tier at $299/month for food bloggers and culinary schools needing team collaboration and analytics.

Based on comparable platforms: CAC of $12 through content marketing, LTV of $240 (4-year average retention × $60/year), yielding 20:1 LTV/CAC ratio. Gross margins of 92% given minimal infrastructure costs. Path to $100M ARR: 50K paid users year 1 ($3M), 200K year 2 ($12M), 600K year 3 ($36M), 1.7M year 4 ($100M) - representing just 0.7% of addressable market.

## Why Now?

GitHub pioneered version control for code in 2008. Figma brought it to design in 2016. CookShare brings it to recipes in 2025. The shift: 68% of millennials now document their cooking digitally (versus 12% in 2019), AI can now parse recipe formats accurately at scale, and COVID permanently changed home cooking habits with 2.5x more people cooking daily.

Five years ago, structured recipe data was impossible - ingredients were buried in prose. Today, LLMs can extract and normalize recipe data with 99% accuracy at $0.001 per recipe. Five years from now, every recipe will be version-controlled and AI-optimized. The inflection point is NOW: OpenAI's structured outputs launched October 2024, making recipe parsing finally economical at scale.

## Competition & Moat

Direct competitors include Yummly (30M users, $15M revenue, acquired by Whirlpool), focused on meal planning not version control; Paprika ($4.99 app, 1M downloads) offers recipe saving but no collaboration or versioning; and Copy Me That (500K users) provides basic recipe clipping without modification tracking.

Our unfair advantage: network effects from recipe forking create exponential content growth. Each modification improves the parent recipe's data. After 1,000 forks, we know definitively that reducing sugar by 20% improves ratings by 15%. Competitors have static recipes; we have evolving recipe intelligence.

Defensibility comes from the recipe graph - relationships between modifications, outcomes, and user preferences that become impossible to replicate. Moving fast, we can capture recipe modification data competitors can't access retroactively.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Top 3 existential risks: (1) Platform adoption requires behavior change from copy-paste habits - mitigated by browser extension that auto-imports and versions existing recipe bookmarks. (2) Food bloggers might resist cannibalization of ad revenue - solved by revenue sharing on popular forked recipes. (3) Pinterest or Google could copy features - but they lack version control DNA and would need to rebuild from scratch.

Why hasn't Pinterest done this? They monetize browsing, not cooking. Their $2B revenue comes from keeping users scrolling, not helping them cook efficiently. We monetize successful cooking outcomes. Most overlook that recipe modification data is more valuable than recipe content itself - it's the difference between knowing a recipe exists versus knowing exactly how to make it work for you.
