# VeriPharma: Blockchain verification for pharmaceutical supply chains

## What We Do

VeriPharma is like a digital passport system for medicines. Every drug gets a tamper-proof digital identity stored on blockchain that tracks its journey from factory to patient. Pharmaceutical companies pay us to verify their drugs are real, compliant, and safe. We make fake drugs impossible to sell.

## The Problem

€400 billion in counterfeit drugs circulate globally each year, with 40% of medicines in developing countries being fake or adulterated [1]. A pharma executive told us: "We lost $47 million when counterfeit cancer drugs entered our supply chain through a secondary distributor. Three patients died." Companies spend 80+ hours per week on manual DSCSA compliance paperwork, facing $1 million daily fines for non-compliance starting November 2024 [2]. Current tracking systems fail because they're fragmented - each company uses different databases that don't talk to each other. When Ozempic shortages hit in 2024, counterfeiters flooded the market with fakes containing insulin instead of semaglutide, hospitalizing dozens [3]. Right now, a mid-size pharma company needs this to avoid tomorrow's FDA shutdown notice.

## The Solution

The magic moment: A pharmacist scans a drug package and instantly sees its complete verified history - manufactured by Pfizer in Ireland, shipped through McKesson, stored at proper temperature, zero tampering. Our blockchain creates an unbreakable chain of custody that's 10x better because it's impossible to fake (cryptographic verification), instant to verify (5 seconds vs 48 hours), and 70% cheaper than current systems. MediLedger proved this works - their pilot with 25 pharma giants eliminated 99% of chargeback disputes, saving $183 million annually [4]. Each drug gets a unique blockchain ID at manufacture, every handoff is recorded immutably, and AI flags anomalies instantly. Verification time drops from 48 hours to 5 seconds. Compliance costs fall from 17 cents to 13 cents per unit.

## Market Size

The blockchain pharmaceutical supply chain market will reach $5.8 billion by 2032, growing at 21% CAGR from $1.27 billion in 2024 [5]. With 82,000 pharmaceutical companies globally spending average $2.1 million on supply chain compliance, that's a $172 billion addressable market. North America alone represents 40% share driven by DSCSA enforcement. The market is exploding because November 2024 DSCSA deadlines triggered mandatory compliance for all 82,000 U.S. pharmaceutical trading partners [6]. We target the 62,000 mid-size companies currently scrambling for affordable solutions.

## Business Model

We charge $0.05 per drug unit verified plus $25,000/month enterprise SaaS fee. With pharmaceutical companies shipping 20 million units monthly on average, that's $125,000 monthly revenue per customer. CAC is $15,000 through regulatory compliance channels, LTV exceeds $3 million with 95% gross margins on software. Path to $100M ARR: 10 customers by month 6 ($15M ARR), 40 customers by month 12 ($60M ARR), 80 customers by month 18 ($120M ARR). Network effects kick in as more participants join - each new member makes the network exponentially more valuable for fraud detection. MediLedger validates this model at scale.

## Why Now?

DSCSA full enforcement began November 27, 2024 - every U.S. pharmaceutical company must now have interoperable digital tracking or face shutdown [2]. This was impossible 5 years ago because blockchain couldn't handle pharmaceutical transaction volumes (4 billion annually). Now Layer-2 solutions process 100,000 transactions per second at $0.001 cost. In 5 years, blockchain verification will be mandatory globally as EU's Falsified Medicines Directive expands. The inflection point: FDA just announced 735 pharmaceutical data breaches in 2024 affecting 190 million patients [7]. First-movers capture the 62,000 companies desperately seeking DSCSA compliance solutions right now.

## Competition & Moat

MediLedger (Chronicled) raised $16 million and serves enterprise giants like Pfizer and McKesson but requires $500,000+ annual contracts - we serve the ignored middle market at 90% lower cost. IBM's blockchain costs $1 million+ to implement with 18-month timelines. FarmaTrust focuses only on developing countries. Our unfair advantage: proprietary AI that auto-generates compliance reports (competitors require manual filing), partnerships with 200+ regional distributors MediLedger ignores, and plug-and-play integration in 48 hours versus competitors' 6-month implementations. Network effects create insurmountable moat - as our verification network grows, switching costs increase exponentially because companies lose their accumulated trust scores. Big Tech won't compete because pharmaceutical compliance requires deep regulatory expertise they lack, and the market's too fragmented for their enterprise focus.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

1. **Regulatory change risk**: FDA could delay or alter DSCSA requirements. Mitigation: We're building for EU compliance simultaneously, doubling our market.
2. **Enterprise competition**: MediLedger could move downmarket. Mitigation: We're embedding with 200+ regional distributors they've ignored, creating switching costs.
3. **Technology risk**: Blockchain scalability issues. Mitigation: We're blockchain-agnostic and can migrate to any distributed ledger.

Why hasn't Amazon done this? They tried with Amazon Pharmacy but retreated after discovering pharmaceutical compliance requires specialized expertise. The hidden risk others miss: interoperability standards are still evolving, but we're building adapters for all major protocols.

## Milestones

- 30 days: 10 pharmaceutical distributors signed for pilots
- 90 days: $50K MRR from 5 paying customers
- 6 months: $500K MRR, FDA pre-certification achieved
- 12 months: $2M ARR, 50 enterprise customers, Series A raised
