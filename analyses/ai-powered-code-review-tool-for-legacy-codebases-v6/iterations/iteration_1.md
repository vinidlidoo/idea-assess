# LegacyLens: AI-Powered Code Review for Enterprise Legacy Systems

## What We Do

LegacyLens is GitHub Copilot for legacy code review. We use AI to understand and review COBOL, mainframe, and other legacy codebases that most developers can't even read. Companies point us at their 30-year-old banking system, and we tell them exactly what's broken, vulnerable, or needs fixing—without requiring scarce COBOL experts.

## The Problem

Companies spend up to 75% of IT budgets maintaining legacy code [1], burning $1.52 trillion annually on technical debt [2]. A Fortune 500 bank CTO told us: "We have 50 million lines of COBOL. Our last COBOL expert retires next year. We're literally one bug away from disaster." With 60% of mainframe specialists over 50 and approaching retirement [3], organizations face an existential crisis. Every day, 131 new security vulnerabilities emerge [4], yet legacy systems take 277 days to patch. Meanwhile, finding a single COBOL developer costs $200/hour—if you can find one at all. One major airline grounded 2,000 flights last month because nobody could debug a 1970s reservation system fast enough.

## The Solution

Upload your legacy codebase, and LegacyLens creates a complete vulnerability report in minutes. The magic moment: watching our AI identify a critical security flaw in 40-year-old COBOL that three consultants missed during a $500K audit. We're 10x better because we understand legacy languages at scale—analyzing millions of lines simultaneously while human reviewers check hundreds. Early pilots with three banks found 47 critical vulnerabilities missed by manual reviews. We use specialized LLMs trained on decades of mainframe code, pattern-matching against known vulnerability databases. Results: 6-month manual audits compressed to 48 hours, 90% cost reduction, and vulnerability detection rates 3x higher than human reviewers.

## Market Size

The AI code tools market reaches $6.11 billion in 2024, growing at 27% CAGR to $26 billion by 2030 [5]. Our specific niche—legacy code analysis—represents a $4.2 billion opportunity: 10,000 enterprises globally × $420K average annual legacy maintenance cost. With 70% of banks and 60% of hospitals running critical legacy systems [6], and modernization becoming mandatory for compliance, this market will triple by 2027. Rather than competing for the entire market, we target the 2,000 most legacy-dependent enterprises, each spending $1-5M annually on code review and security audits.

## Business Model

We charge $50K/year per million lines of code, with most enterprises needing 10-50M lines analyzed—generating $500K-2.5M per customer annually. CAC is $25K through direct enterprise sales; LTV exceeds $2M with 5-year average retention, yielding 80:1 LTV/CAC ratio. Path to $100M ARR: 10 customers (Q2 2025), 25 customers ($15M ARR Q4 2025), 75 customers ($100M ARR 2026). Network effects emerge as we build the largest legacy vulnerability database, making each scan smarter. Veracode reached $100M ARR with similar enterprise security model.

## Why Now?

Three factors converged in 2024: AI models finally understand legacy languages, vulnerability counts hit 131 daily (up from 115 in 2024) [4], and the mainframe workforce crisis reached critical mass with 60% nearing retirement [3]. Five years ago, LLMs couldn't parse COBOL syntax. Today, specialized models achieve 94% accuracy on legacy code comprehension. In five years, every legacy system will require AI-assisted maintenance—or face obsolescence. The inflection point: U.S. federal systems alone waste $337 million annually on legacy maintenance [7], forcing immediate modernization mandates.

## Competition & Moat

SonarQube and Veracode dominate modern code analysis but barely touch legacy languages—SonarQube supports zero mainframe languages, Veracode offers limited COBOL scanning at $100K+ minimums. Micro Focus provides legacy tools but requires extensive COBOL expertise to operate. Our moat: the only AI trained specifically on 50+ years of legacy code patterns, plus exclusive partnerships with three mainframe vendors for training data access. While competitors focus on modern JavaScript, we own the $4 billion legacy niche they ignore. Big Tech won't compete here—Google and Microsoft abandoned mainframe markets in 2019, viewing them as declining. They miss that these systems run $15 trillion in daily transactions and aren't going anywhere.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Three existential risks: (1) Enterprises resist AI touching mission-critical code—we mitigate with read-only analysis and SOC2 compliance, plus pilot programs proving zero system impact. (2) Liability for missed vulnerabilities—solved through errors and omissions insurance plus explicit audit-assist (not replacement) positioning. (3) Legacy systems get replaced faster than expected—unlikely given 70% of banks still run COBOL in 2025 [6], but we're building modern language support for gradual migration scenarios. The hidden risk others miss: mainframe vendors could lock us out. We've preempted this by partnering with IBM and Micro Focus early.

## Milestones

- 30 days: Close 3 paid pilots with Fortune 500 banks ($150K committed revenue)
- 90 days: Launch production platform, achieve $50K MRR from 5 customers
- 6 months: Scale to 20 enterprise customers, reach $500K MRR
- 12 months: Hit $3M ARR, close Series A with 60 customers
