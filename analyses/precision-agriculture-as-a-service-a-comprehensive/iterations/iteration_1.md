# FieldBot: Farming Robots for Everyone

## What We Do

FieldBot provides robot teams that plant, monitor, and harvest crops on farms. Instead of buying million-dollar machines, farmers rent our robots for $2-5K per acre per season. Like hiring a crew that works 24/7, never complains, and cuts chemical use by 30%. We handle everything - deployment, maintenance, data analysis. Farmers just farm better.

## The Problem

Small farms are bleeding out. Labor costs hit $19.75/hour in California for H2A workers [1], with specialty crops eating 38% of expenses on labor alone [7]. A 200-acre berry farm spends $1.5M annually just on harvest labor - if they can find workers. "We left 30% of strawberries rotting because we couldn't get pickers," says a Salinas farmer. Meanwhile, a new John Deere harvester costs $800,000+, impossible for farms under 500 acres.

Equipment sharing doesn't work - harvest windows are too tight. Custom harvesting at $45/acre is unreliable. Labor contractors ghost you mid-season. The result? Small farms can't compete with mega-operations, losing $81/acre on corn in 2024. They're trapped: can't afford robots, can't find workers, can't stay profitable. One bad harvest and they're done.

## The Solution

The magic happens when our first robot rolls onto your field. Within 4 hours, it's mapped your entire farm, identified every plant, and started working. Our swarm approach deploys 5-10 lightweight robots per 100 acres, each specialized: planters, weeders, harvesters. Computer vision identifies ripe produce, disease, and optimal harvest timing - matching Tortuga AgTech's award-winning strawberry harvesting system [2].

We cut harvesting costs by 50% while working 24/7. A 200-acre strawberry farm saves $750K annually. Weeding robots reduce herbicide use 70% through precision spraying, like John Deere's See & Spray saving farmers 59% on chemicals [3]. Real results: 25% yield increase from optimal harvest timing, 30% less crop loss. Our robots cost $50K each to build (vs $800K combines), enabling the subscription model that makes this accessible.

## Market Size

The precision agriculture market hits $14.18B in 2025, growing 13.3% annually to $43.64B by 2034 [4]. Agricultural robots specifically reach $25B in 2025, exploding to $75B by 2030 at 24.6% CAGR [5].

Bottom-up: 250,000 US farms between 10-500 acres growing specialty crops. Average 50 acres specialty crops × $3,500/acre = $175K per farm annually. That's $44B addressable market in the US alone. With robotic harvesting reducing costs 50% and H2A wages rising 5% yearly, adoption accelerates. California's 30,000 specialty crop farms alone represent $5.25B opportunity.

## Business Model

$2,500/acre for basic monitoring and weeding, $5,000/acre for full-service including harvesting. Average farm: 50 acres × $4,000 = $200K annual contract value. Three-year contracts with 90% retention expected.

CAC: $25K (3-month sales cycle). LTV: $540K (3 years × $200K × 90% retention). Gross margin: 65% after robot amortization.

Path to $100M ARR: Year 1: 50 farms ($10M), Year 2: 250 farms ($50M), Year 3: 500 farms ($100M). Network effects kick in - neighboring farms see results, word spreads. Each robot fleet serves 5 farms, driving utilization to 80%.

## Why Now?

Monarch Tractor just raised $133M in July 2024 - the largest agricultural robotics round ever [6]. Why? Labor shortage hit crisis: 70% unfilled positions, H2A wages jumped to $19.75/hour, and farms are desperate.

Five years ago, computer vision couldn't reliably identify strawberries. Today, Tortuga's robots win industry awards for transforming vision into reality. Edge computing costs dropped 90%. LiDAR sensors fell from $75K to $500. Battery costs plummeted 80% since 2010.

The inflection point: 384,900 H2A positions certified in 2024, up 30% from 2020. Small farms either automate or die. First movers lock in multi-year contracts before competitors scale.

## Competition & Moat

Monarch Tractor ($220M raised) sells $120K autonomous tractors - great for row crops, useless for strawberries. FarmWise ($65M raised) only does weeding at $150/acre - single-function, limited value. Iron Ox and AppHarvest focus on indoor farms - different market entirely.

Our advantage: full-stack RaaS model. Others sell equipment or single services - we provide complete farming operations. Multi-robot swarms handle entire growing cycles. Our 3-year contracts create massive switching costs.

Local fleet deployment creates density advantages - one technician serves 20 farms in 50-mile radius. Data network effect: each farm improves our AI. After 1,000 farms, our yield predictions become unbeatable. John Deere could compete but they're married to equipment sales - channel conflict prevents RaaS pivot.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Weather delays: Robots can't work in heavy rain/snow. Mitigation: Deploy 20% extra capacity, flex scheduling across farms, weather insurance products.

Technical complexity: Managing 50+ robots across multiple farms. Mitigation: Hire autonomous vehicle engineers from Waymo/Cruise layoffs. Start with 10-farm pilots, scale gradually.

Farmer adoption: Traditional industry, skeptical of change. Mitigation: Performance guarantees - if yields don't increase 20%, money back. Start in California where labor crisis is most acute. Show ROI in first season.

Why hasn't John Deere done this? They're married to $800K equipment sales - RaaS would cannibalize their core business.

## Milestones

- 30 days: Sign 5 pilot farms in Salinas Valley for 2025 season
- 90 days: Deploy first 25-robot fleet, achieve $50K MRR
- 6 months: 20 farms committed, $400K MRR, Series A conversations begin
- 12 months: 50 farms operating, $1M MRR, close $30M Series A

Idea Input: "Precision Agriculture-as-a-Service

A comprehensive farming automation service that deploys fleets of autonomous robots for planting, monitoring, and harvesting specialty crops on small to medium farms (10-500 acres). The robots would use AI vision systems for disease detection, selective harvesting, and yield optimization. Farmers would pay $2-5K per acre per season rather than purchasing expensive equipment. This democratizes access to precision agriculture technology, helping smaller farms compete while reducing chemical use by 30% and increasing yields by 25%."
