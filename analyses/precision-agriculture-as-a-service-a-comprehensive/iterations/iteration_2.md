# CropBot: Robot Fleets for Small Farms

## What We Do

CropBot provides robot teams that plant, monitor, and harvest crops on small farms. Instead of buying $800K machines, farmers rent our robots for $3-5K per acre per season. Like hiring a harvest crew that works 24/7, never complains, and cuts chemical use by 70%. We handle everything - deployment, maintenance, data. Farmers just farm better.

## The Problem

384,900 H2A visas certified in 2024, yet 16 states cut their usage [3]. Labor now eats 40-42% of specialty crop expenses at $19.75/hour in California [1][2]. A 200-acre strawberry farm burns $1.6M annually on harvest labor alone. "We left 30% of strawberries rotting in the field - couldn't find pickers at any price," reports a Watsonville grower. Meanwhile, a John Deere harvester costs $800,000 - three years' profit for most small farms.

Equipment co-ops fail when everyone needs machines the same week. Custom operators vanish at peak harvest. Labor contractors take deposits then ghost you mid-season. Small farms lose $120/acre while corporate operations with robots profit $200/acre. Reality: 89,000 US specialty crop farms are one bad harvest from bankruptcy, watching their market share evaporate to automated mega-farms.

## The Solution

Hour 1: Robots arrive on flatbed. Hour 4: Entire farm mapped. Hour 8: First strawberries harvested. We deploy 8-12 specialized robots per 100 acres - not general-purpose machines but purpose-built tools: strawberry pickers with soft grippers, lettuce harvesters with precision cutting, weeders with sub-inch accuracy. Our computer vision matches John Deere's See & Spray that achieved 59% herbicide reduction across 1 million acres in 2024 [4]. Each robot makes 50,000 decisions per hour: ripe/not ripe, weed/crop, diseased/healthy.

We cut harvesting costs by 40% while working 24/7. A 200-acre berry farm saves $640K annually. Precision spraying reduces herbicide use 70%, matching industry benchmarks. Real results from comparable tech: 25% yield increase through optimal harvest timing, 30% less crop loss. Our modular robots cost $150-200K each to build (vs $800K combines), with components sourced from the industrial robotics supply chain where hardware represents 60% of system cost [5].

## Market Size

Agricultural robotics reaches $25B in 2025, growing to $75B by 2030 at 24.6% CAGR [6]. North America leads with 37% market share.

Bottom-up: 89,000 US farms between 50-500 acres grow specialty crops (USDA data). Average 100 acres specialty crops × $4,000/acre = $400K per farm annually. That's $35.6B addressable market in the US. With H2A wages rising and robots proving 40-60% cost reduction, adoption accelerates. California's 30,000 specialty crop farms alone represent $12B opportunity.

## Business Model

$3,000/acre for monitoring and weeding, $5,000/acre for full-service including harvesting. Average farm: 100 acres × $4,000 = $400K annual contract value. Three-year contracts standard.

CAC: $50K (6-month sales cycle for hardware). LTV: $1.08M (3 years × $400K × 90% retention). Gross margin: 45% after robot depreciation and operations.

Path to $100M ARR: Year 2: 50 farms ($20M), Year 3: 150 farms ($60M), Year 4: 250 farms ($100M). Each robot fleet serves 3-4 farms seasonally.

## Why Now?

Monarch Tractor raised $133M in July 2024 - the largest agricultural robotics round ever [7]. Why? The labor crisis peaked: H2A visa growth stalled at 2% after a decade of double-digit increases, while wages hit $19.75/hour [3].

Five years ago, vision systems couldn't reliably identify produce. Today, commercial systems achieve 59% herbicide savings at scale. Edge computing dropped 90% cost. LiDAR fell from $75K to $500. Battery costs down 80% since 2010. The market has 60+ commercial agricultural robots available, proving technical feasibility [8].

## Competition & Moat

Reality check: 330+ agricultural robotics companies exist, with 60+ selling commercial robots today [8]. Carbon Robotics ($85M raised) burns weeds with lasers - brilliant but only weeding. GUSS autonomous sprayers work great for orchards, useless for strawberries. Burro's follow-me carts help but don't replace pickers. Monarch's $120K autonomous tractors handle row crops, not specialty produce. FarmWise ($65M raised) weeds efficiently but leaves harvesting to humans.

Our advantage: full-season RaaS covering planting through harvest. Others sell equipment or single services - we provide complete operations. Local fleet density creates 30% cost advantage through shared technicians. After 100 farms, our yield prediction AI becomes unmatched. Three-year contracts create high switching costs. John Deere could compete but equipment sales channel conflict prevents RaaS model.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Manufacturing at scale: Need 250+ robots by Year 2. Industrial robots cost $150-200K to build with 60% hardware costs [5]. Mitigation: Contract manufacturing with Universal Robots (proven 50,000 units/year capacity). We design agricultural tools and software only.

Slow hardware adoption: B2B SaaS hits $1M ARR in 2.75 years median. Hardware robotics takes 3-4 years minimum. Mitigation: Target California's desperate farms losing $500K+ annually to labor shortage. Money-back guarantee if we don't cut costs 30%. Start with 10 beta farms, expand through referrals.

Technical failure risk: One viral video of robots destroying crops kills the company. Mitigation: 1,000 hours testing per robot model. Remote kill switches. $50M product liability insurance. Deploy incrementally - 10% of farm first season.

## Milestones

- 30 days: Sign 3 pilot farms in Salinas Valley for trials
- 90 days: Deploy first fleet, achieve operational proof
- 6 months: 10 farms contracted, $200K MRR pipeline
- 12 months: 25 farms operating, close $15M Series A

Idea Input: "Precision Agriculture-as-a-Service

A comprehensive farming automation service that deploys fleets of autonomous robots for planting, monitoring, and harvesting specialty crops on small to medium farms (10-500 acres). The robots would use AI vision systems for disease detection, selective harvesting, and yield optimization. Farmers would pay $2-5K per acre per season rather than purchasing expensive equipment. This democratizes access to precision agriculture technology, helping smaller farms compete while reducing chemical use by 30% and increasing yields by 25%."
