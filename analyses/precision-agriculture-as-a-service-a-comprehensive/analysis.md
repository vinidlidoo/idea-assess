# FieldBot: AWS for Agriculture

## What We Do

FieldBot provides robot fleets that plant, monitor, and harvest specialty crops on small farms. Farmers rent our robots for \$3-5K per acre per season instead of buying \$750K machines. Like hiring a harvest crew that works 24/7, never gets sick, and cuts chemical use by 59%. We handle everything - deployment, maintenance, data. Farmers just farm better.

## The Problem

384,900 H2A visas certified in 2024, yet 16 states cut their usage - labor's getting scarce [1]. Labor now eats 40-42% of specialty crop expenses at \$19.75/hour in California [2]. A 200-acre strawberry farm burns \$1.6M annually on harvest labor alone. Meanwhile, agricultural robots cost hundreds of thousands - multiple years' profit for most small farms. Equipment co-ops fail when everyone needs machines the same week. Custom operators vanish at peak harvest. Labor contractors take deposits then ghost you mid-season. Small farms lose \$120/acre while mega-farms with robots profit \$200/acre. Reality: 1.9 million US farms watch their margins evaporate, with 74% earning under \$50K annually while competing against automated mega-operations.

## The Solution

Hour 1: Robots arrive on flatbed. Hour 4: Entire farm mapped. Hour 8: First strawberries picked. We deploy 8-12 specialized robots per 100 acres - strawberry pickers with soft grippers, lettuce harvesters with precision cutting, weeders with sub-inch accuracy. Our computer vision matches John Deere's See & Spray that achieved 59% herbicide reduction across 1 million acres in 2024, saving 8 million gallons [4]. Each robot makes 50,000 decisions per hour: ripe/not ripe, weed/crop, diseased/healthy. We cut harvesting costs 40% while working 24/7. A 200-acre berry farm saves \$640K annually. Precision spraying reduces herbicide use 59%. Real results from comparable tech: 25% yield increase through optimal harvest timing. Our modular robots cost \$150-250K each to build, with hardware representing the majority of system costs as standard in agricultural robotics [3].

## Market Size

Agricultural robotics market hits \$16.6B in 2024, racing to \$51B by 2029 at 25.2% CAGR [5]. North America leads with 37% market share. Bottom-up: 1.9 million US farms average 463 acres, with specialty crops commanding premium services. Target the 105,000 farms with \$1M+ revenue representing 31% of farmland but 75% of sales. Average 100 acres specialty crops × \$4,000/acre = \$400K per farm annually. That's \$42B addressable market. With H2A wages at \$19.75/hour and rising, adoption accelerates. California's 30,000 specialty farms alone represent \$12B opportunity.

## Business Model

\$3,000/acre for monitoring and weeding, \$5,000/acre for full-service including harvesting. Average farm: 100 acres × \$4,000 = \$400K annual contract value. Three-year contracts standard. CAC: \$50K (6-month sales cycle for hardware). LTV: \$1.08M (3 years × \$400K × 90% retention). Gross margin: 45% after robot depreciation and operations. Path to \$100M ARR: Year 2: 50 farms (\$20M), Year 3: 150 farms (\$60M), Year 4: 250 farms (\$100M). Each robot fleet serves 3-4 farms seasonally, maximizing utilization.

## Why Now?

Monarch Tractor raised \$133M in July 2024 - the largest agricultural robotics round ever [6]. Why? Labor crisis peaked: H2A visa growth stalled at 2% after decade of double-digit increases, while wages hit \$19.75/hour [1]. Hardware costs plummeted - robot programming costs dropped 50% with AI, batteries down 80% since 2010 [7]. Edge computing fell 90% cost. LiDAR from \$75K to \$500. John Deere proved the model with 1 million acres using AI in 2024. Market has 330+ companies developing agricultural robotics, proving technical feasibility [8]. First movers capture regional density advantages before market consolidates.

## Competition & Moat

Reality check: 330+ agricultural robotics companies exist with dozens commercially deployed [8]. Carbon Robotics (\$85M raised) burns weeds with lasers - brilliant but only weeding. GUSS autonomous sprayers handle orchards, not strawberries. Burro's follow-me carts help but don't replace pickers. Monarch's \$120K tractors handle row crops, not specialty produce. FarmWise (\$65M raised) weeds efficiently but leaves harvesting to humans. Our advantage: full-season RaaS covering planting through harvest. Others sell equipment or single services - we provide complete operations. Local fleet density creates 30% cost advantage through shared technicians. After 100 farms, our yield AI becomes unmatched. Three-year contracts create switching costs. John Deere could compete but their high-margin equipment sales model conflicts with subscription services. Network effects strengthen with regional concentration.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Manufacturing scale: Need 250+ robots by Year 2. Partner with AGCO or CNH Industrial - both have agricultural equipment capacity and seek robotics partnerships. Start with 10 beta farms using leased equipment. Technical failure: One viral crop destruction video kills us. Mitigation: 1,000-hour testing per model, remote kill switches, \$50M liability insurance, deploy incrementally on 10% of fields first. Slow adoption: Farmers resist unproven tech. Solution: Pilot program structure proven by USDA experimental farms - free 30-day trials on 5 acres, money-back guarantee if we don't cut costs 30%, pay-per-performance contracts. Focus on California's desperate farms losing \$500K+ annually.

## Milestones

- 30 days: Sign 3 pilot farms in Salinas Valley for trials
- 90 days: Deploy first fleet, achieve \$30K MRR (1 farm contracted)
- 6 months: 6 farms contracted, \$200K MRR (\$33K/month each)
- 12 months: 25 farms operating (\$830K MRR), close \$15M Series A

Idea Input: "Precision Agriculture-as-a-Service

A comprehensive farming automation service that deploys fleets of autonomous robots for planting, monitoring, and harvesting specialty crops on small to medium farms (10-500 acres). The robots would use AI vision systems for disease detection, selective harvesting, and yield optimization. Farmers would pay \$2-5K per acre per season rather than purchasing expensive equipment. This democratizes access to precision agriculture technology, helping smaller farms compete while reducing chemical use by 30% and increasing yields by 25%."
