        "explanation": "The cited article directly contradicts this claim, stating that Meta's median review time was only a few hours.",
        "evidence": "The Meta article states: 'our median (P50) hours in review for a diff was only a few hours, which we felt was pretty good.' The 13-hour figure is not mentioned anywhere.",
        "suggestion": "Either correct the claim to accurately reflect Meta's actual median review time (a few hours) or remove this reference entirely."

The Meta PR timing claim (13 hours vs actual few hours) and the unsupported 73% AI usage statistic are significant factual errors that undermine the credibility of the analysis.
