# LearnAI: Personal AI tutor for every student

## What We Do

LearnAI is a personal AI tutor that gives every student their own one-on-one teacher. We use GPT-4 to answer questions, explain concepts, and guide students through homework and test prep. Students text or voice chat with their AI tutor anytime, getting instant help in any subject. Think of it as having a smart teacher in your pocket 24/7.

## The Problem

Parents spend $60 billion yearly on tutoring in the US alone, with average costs of $50-80 per hour [1]. A struggling algebra student needs help at 9pm on Sunday - no tutor available. Mom posts desperately on Facebook: "My daughter is failing math and crying over homework every night. We can't afford $200/week for tutoring." Meanwhile, 2 out of 3 students fall behind grade level in math by high school. Teachers have 30 students per class and can't provide individual attention. Traditional tutoring apps like Wyzant or Tutor.com still cost $40+/hour and require scheduling. Students wait days for help while assignments pile up. The result: 1.2 million students drop out annually, costing them $260,000 in lifetime earnings. The education gap widens as wealthy families hire private tutors while others fall further behind.

## The Solution

Students open LearnAI and snap a photo of their homework problem. Within seconds, our AI tutor explains the concept step-by-step, asks guiding questions, and ensures understanding - not just giving answers. The "magic moment" hits when a struggling student finally grasps fractions after our AI walks them through visual examples personalized to their learning style. We're 10x better because we're available instantly, infinitely patient, and 95% cheaper than human tutors. Harvard research shows AI tutoring doubles learning gains compared to traditional classrooms [2]. Our pilot with 500 students showed 73% improved their grades by at least one letter in 8 weeks. We use multimodal AI to process text, images, and voice, adapting explanations based on each student's pace and comprehension level. Students spend 45 minutes daily on average, solving 3x more practice problems than before.

## Market Size

The global AI tutoring market reached $1.63 billion in 2024 and will hit $7.99 billion by 2030, growing 30.5% annually [3]. Bottom-up: 56 million K-12 students in the US Ã— $20/month subscription = $13.4 billion opportunity domestically. The broader AI in education market explodes to $73.7 billion by 2033 [4]. Post-pandemic, 87% of students use digital learning tools daily. Gen Alpha expects AI-powered, on-demand everything. With schools adopting AI tools and states like Louisiana deploying AI tutors to 100,000 students, we're at the adoption inflection point. Early movers will capture school district contracts worth millions.

## Business Model

We charge $19.99/month for unlimited AI tutoring, compared to $200+/month for weekly human tutoring. Schools pay $5/student/month for district-wide licenses. Our unit economics: CAC of $25 through social media (TikTok viral "homework help" content), LTV of $240 (12-month average retention), yielding a 9.6:1 LTV:CAC ratio. Path to $100M ARR: 10,000 paid users month 6, 100,000 by month 12, 420,000 by month 24. Network effects kick in as students share solutions and compete on leaderboards. We're building the Duolingo of general education - engaging, affordable, addictive.

## Why Now?

GPT-4's multimodal capabilities launched in 2024 enable understanding of handwritten math, diagrams, and complex formatting - impossible before [5]. API costs dropped 90% since 2023, making $20/month subscriptions profitable. Gemini 2.5's million-token context window means our AI remembers entire textbooks and semester-long student progress. Five years ago, AI couldn't solve basic word problems. Today, it scores in the 90th percentile on AP exams. In 2025, 46% of students already use ChatGPT for homework - they're desperate for a specialized solution. Microsoft's partnership with Khan Academy proves Big Tech sees the opportunity. We'll capture the K-12 market while they focus on free tools for teachers.

## Competition & Moat

Khan Academy's Khanmigo costs $4/month but focuses on structured lessons, not homework help [6]. Chegg ($15/month) provides answers without teaching. Photomath (free/$10) only handles math. Our fatal advantage: multimodal AI that handles all subjects with true tutoring, not answer-dumping. We're building proprietary student learning models - after 1 million interactions, our AI understands common misconceptions better than any competitor. Switching costs emerge as students build learning histories and achievement streaks. Khanmigo can't expand to homework help without angering teachers. Chegg's brand is toxic in schools. Google won't build this because it requires charging consumers directly, which they historically avoid. Our moat deepens as we gather millions of student interactions to fine-tune subject-specific models.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Risk 1: Schools ban our app as a "cheating tool." Mitigation: Teacher dashboard showing student work, time spent, and concepts practiced - positioning as homework helper, not homework doer. Risk 2: OpenAI raises API prices or restricts access. Mitigation: Multi-model approach using Claude, Gemini, and open-source alternatives; building proprietary models for common queries. Risk 3: Parents worry about AI replacing human connection. Mitigation: Hybrid model with human tutors for monthly check-ins; emphasis on AI as supplement, not replacement. The hidden risk others miss: Student data privacy regulations could limit personalization. We're building privacy-preserving learning models that keep data on-device.

## Milestones
