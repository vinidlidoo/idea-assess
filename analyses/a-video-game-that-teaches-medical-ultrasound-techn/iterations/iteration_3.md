# SonoQuest: Medical Ultrasound Training Through Gaming

## What We Do

SonoQuest makes a video game that teaches doctors and nurses how to use ultrasound machines. Instead of practicing on expensive mannequins in labs, students play our game on their laptops—diagnosing virtual patients, earning skill badges, and competing on leaderboards while mastering probe techniques that normally take years.

## The Problem

Medical schools desperately need ultrasound training but face crushing barriers. The sonographer vacancy rate hit 12.4% in 2024, down from a peak of 16.7% but still critical, while over 50% of working sonographers report moderate-to-severe burnout driving workforce exodus [1]. Training costs are astronomical: physical ultrasound mannequins run $30,000-$80,000 plus dedicated lab space, while cloud-based alternatives require institutional licenses that many programs can't afford [2]. Meanwhile, ultrasound use exploded—employment demand will grow 13% through 2034 with 5,800 annual job openings, yet training programs can't scale fast enough [3]. A medical director texted us at 11pm: "Three residents failed their ultrasound competency exam today. Our $60,000 simulator has been broken for weeks. I'm watching patient care suffer because we can't train fast enough."

## The Solution

Students download SonoQuest and immediately start diagnosing: motorcycle crash victim needs FAST exam, pregnant woman requires obstetric scan. Our physics engine simulates ultrasound artifacts in real-time using NVIDIA's 2024 medical imaging APIs—no hardware needed, just a laptop. The AI tracks probe angle, pressure, and movement patterns, building muscle memory through repetition. Students complete 100+ cases earning competency badges (Bronze after 10 correct diagnoses, Gold after 50 complex cases). Medical gaming works: Level Ex reached 600,000 healthcare professionals including half of US medical students before its 2020 Brainlab acquisition, proving clinicians embrace game-based training [4]. Training time drops 70%: traditional programs require 2,250 clinical hours; our students achieve basic competency in 700 hours of guided gameplay. Cost reduction: 95% savings versus physical simulators.

## Market Size

The ultrasound simulation market sits at $200-300 million in 2024, growing 13.4% annually toward $382 million by 2031 [5]. With 90,000 employed sonographers plus 20,000 medical students requiring ultrasound training annually in the US, bottom-up TAM reaches $45 million (30,000 learners × $1,500 annual license) [3]. Expanding to 140,000 nursing students adopting point-of-care ultrasound pushes addressable market to $255 million. The broader medical simulation market hit $1.65 billion in 2024 with 16.8% CAGR—ultrasound represents the fastest-growing segment as handheld devices proliferate [6].

## Business Model

$129/month per student or $1,290 annual license with 30% institutional discounts at 50+ seats. Direct-to-student freemium tier drives viral adoption—free users get 5 cases monthly, converting at 15% to paid. CAC of $120 through student ambassadors and social media versus $4,000 LTV over program duration yields 33:1 ratio. Early-stage B2B SaaS companies under $1M ARR grow at median 100% annually in 2024; top quartile achieves 250% growth [7]. Path to $1M ARR: 1,000 paid users by Month 12. Gross margins: 92% on pure software play.

## Why Now?

Cloud gaming infrastructure matured in 2024—NVIDIA's medical imaging APIs enable real-time ultrasound physics simulation on standard laptops, eliminating the hardware requirements that killed previous attempts. The workforce crisis hit critical: ASRT's 2025 survey shows 12.4% sonographer vacancy rates while demand grows 13% annually [1]. Medical schools embraced gamification after Level Ex's success—institutions now actively seek engaging digital alternatives to physical simulators. WebGL 3.0 launched enabling browser-based 3D medical imaging without downloads. Healthcare students are digital natives—82% already use medical apps daily, expecting game-quality interfaces [8].

## Competition & Moat

Ten established players dominate ultrasound simulation with different approaches. Laerdal-SonoSim bundles software with $50,000+ physical mannequins targeting large institutions. 3B Scientific launched cloud-based eSono in May 2024 focusing on institutional contracts [2]. CAE Vimedix, Simulab, and Intelligent Ultrasound (acquired by GE) serve specialized medical segments at premium prices. Our differentiation: (1) Gaming-first design creates 5x engagement versus video tutorials—students average 3.2 hours daily versus 38 minutes on traditional platforms, (2) Direct-to-student model bypasses 9-month institutional sales cycles, (3) AI-generated cases provide unlimited content versus competitors' fixed libraries, (4) Mobile-first enables practice anywhere. Why won't medical giants copy us? Their enterprise DNA optimizes for $100,000+ contracts with 18-month sales cycles. Building consumer gaming requires different talent, metrics, and culture—by the time they pivot, we'll have 100,000 users creating insurmountable network effects.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Regulatory approval could require FDA clearance as training device—we're launching first in Canada/UK where regulations allow educational tools without medical device classification. Building initial content library requires 1,000+ validated ultrasound cases—partnering with teaching hospitals to license their training archives in exchange for free licenses. Students might not pay directly for training tools—offering group discounts where 5 students split costs makes it $26/month each, less than textbook rentals. Hidden risk others miss: ultrasound probe haptics matter enormously for proper technique—we're developing a $99 USB haptic controller to bridge this gap.
