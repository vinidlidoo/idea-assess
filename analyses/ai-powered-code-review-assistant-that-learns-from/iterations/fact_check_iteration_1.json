        "explanation": "The cited Meta blog post states the median review time was 'only a few hours', not 13 hours. This is a significant factual error that misrepresents the source.",
        "evidence": "Meta's blog states: 'our median (P50) hours in review for a diff was only a few hours' and P75 (slowest 25%) could take 'up to a day'",
        "suggestion": "Correct the claim to accurately reflect Meta's actual median review time of 'a few hours' or use a different statistic"

        "evidence": "Codacy blog states: '64% of developers have integrated AI into their code production workflows' and '62% use AI to review their code'",
