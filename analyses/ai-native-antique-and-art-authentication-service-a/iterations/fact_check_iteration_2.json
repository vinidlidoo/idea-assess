        "url_checked": "https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/more-then-half-of-art-is-fake",
        "explanation": "The 50% figure is misleading as it's based on artworks already suspected of being fake sent for authentication, not a random sample of all art.",
        "evidence": "Fine Art Expert Institute's director admitted their 70-90% fake rate comes from already-suspicious works sent for testing. He stated: 'People who come to us often already have a question about the authenticity of the work... this does not mean that on the market, 70 to 90 percent of work is fake.'",
        "suggestion": "Clarify that this statistic applies to suspected forgeries sent for authentication, not all art in circulation, or use a more conservative estimate with proper context."

        "explanation": "The claim uses present tense ('accounts for') for a 2025 projection, which could be misleading since we're currently in 2025.",
        "evidence": "Source states 'Japan accounts for 40% of global NFT activity in 2025' but this appears to be a projection rather than verified current data.",
        "suggestion": "Rephrase to clarify this is a projection or prediction, such as 'Japan is projected to account for 40% of global NFT activity by 2025.'"
