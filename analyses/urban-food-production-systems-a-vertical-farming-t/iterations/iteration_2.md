# LocalGreens: Mini Vertical Farms for Restaurants and Stores

## What We Do

LocalGreens builds mini vertical farms inside restaurants and grocery stores. Think Toast for fresh produce—we install growing systems in your basement, handle all the tech, and you harvest greens daily. Restaurant owners pay $2,500/month to grow herbs and lettuce on-site. No farming experience needed, just harvest and serve.

## The Problem

A Manhattan restaurant owner told us: "I spend $6,000 monthly on greens from California. By the time they arrive after 2,400 miles, 40% is wilted." This is everywhere: US restaurants waste 4-10% of food purchases, costing the industry $30 billion annually [1]. The average lettuce travels 2,000 miles from farm to plate. When extreme weather hit California's farms in 2024, lettuce prices spiked 200% overnight, and restaurants couldn't get supply for weeks. Meanwhile, grocery stores lost $162 billion to food waste in 2023, with produce being the worst category. During COVID, shelves went empty because supply chains broke. Now climate disasters are making disruptions permanent—flooding destroyed 30% of California's lettuce crop in January 2025 alone.

## The Solution

Install our 8x10 foot GrowPod in unused space. Within 21 days, harvest 60 pounds of greens weekly—enough for 500 salads. Our system uses stacked growing trays with advanced LEDs that cut energy costs to 25% of total operations, down from 65% five years ago. The software monitors pH, nutrients, and humidity automatically. One Brooklyn pizzeria cut produce costs 65% and eliminated waste—basil goes from harvest to pizza in 10 minutes. We achieve yields 10-15x higher than field farming through vertical stacking, matching industry leaders [2]. The system uses 95% less water than field farming through recirculated hydroponics. Installation takes one day, training takes two hours. Restaurants see ROI in 24 months through eliminated waste and transport costs.

## Market Size

The vertical farming market hit $6.7 billion in 2025, reaching $16.9 billion by 2030 at 20.3% CAGR [3]. Bottom-up: 175,000 US full-service restaurants spending $4,000/month on leafy greens = $8.4 billion addressable market. Add 20,000 grocery stores with produce departments = $4.8 billion more. The small-format segment specifically is exploding as LED costs dropped 85% since 2020, finally making distributed farms profitable [4]. Investment fell 53% in 2024, but that's because mega-farms failed—the opportunity shifted to our distributed model.

## Business Model

Hardware lease: $2,500/month per GrowPod (includes maintenance). Software: included in lease. Average restaurant installs 2 pods = $5,000 monthly recurring revenue. CAC: $8,000 through trade shows and direct sales. LTV over 3-year average contract: $180,000. That's a 22:1 LTV/CAC ratio. Path to $100M ARR: 200 installations year 1 ($12M), 800 year 2 ($48M), 1,600 year 3 ($96M). Realistic based on median B2B hardware+SaaS taking 2.7 years to $1M ARR [5].

## Why Now?

LED efficiency breakthrough in 2024: prices dropped 85% since 2020 while efficiency improved dramatically, making small farms finally profitable. Five years ago, energy consumed 65% of operating costs—today it's 25% [6]. Meanwhile, major competitors collapsed: Plenty's $1.9 billion bankruptcy and Smallhold's February 2024 shutdown left a market vacuum [7]. They failed chasing scale; we're winning with simplicity. The holy shit moment: Eden Green just raised $40 million for expansion, proving demand while targeting different customers (large distributors vs. our direct restaurant approach) [8].

## Competition & Moat

Eden Green raised $40 million but focuses on large greenhouse facilities for distributors—minimum 100,000 square feet. They can't serve individual restaurants. Smallhold targeted mushrooms only and filed bankruptcy February 2024. Infarm pulled out of North America after burning $600 million. Our advantage: we're the only turnkey small-format solution. Eden Green requires acres; we need 80 square feet. Our lease model removes upfront costs that killed competitors. We own the restaurant relationship through daily monitoring and weekly maintenance visits, creating 36-month switching costs. Big Tech won't compete—Amazon wants to sell produce, not growing systems. Sysco won't touch this because local growing kills their distribution margins.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Energy costs could spike, killing margins. Mitigation: We're integrating solar panels and securing 5-year renewable contracts at fixed rates. Restaurant adoption might stall. Mitigation: Lease model at $2,500/month matches their current produce spend, removing capital requirements. Technical complexity might overwhelm operators. Mitigation: Our tech automatically adjusts everything; restaurants literally just cut and serve. Hidden risk: local health permits vary wildly. We've pre-certified designs in 25 states and have a regulatory team navigating approvals.

## Milestones

- 30 days: 10 signed LOIs from NYC restaurants ($600K pipeline)
- 90 days: 5 operational pilots, $25K MRR
- 6 months: 40 installations, $200K MRR, Series A conversations
- 12 months: 200 installations, $1M MRR, path to profitability clear
