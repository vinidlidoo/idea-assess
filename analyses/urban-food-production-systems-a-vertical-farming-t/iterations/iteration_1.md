# GrowStack: Turnkey Vertical Farms for Hyperlocal Food Production

## What We Do

GrowStack builds modular vertical farms inside restaurants, grocery stores, and apartment buildings. Think of it like a vending machine that grows fresh lettuce instead of storing snacks. Restaurant owners buy our systems to grow their own herbs and greens on-site. We handle everything: installation, monitoring software, and maintenance. No farming experience needed.

## The Problem

A Chicago restaurant owner told us: "I pay \$4,000 monthly for leafy greens that arrive wilted after traveling 1,369 miles. Half gets thrown out." This is the reality: restaurants lose \$75,000 annually on food waste, with produce traveling an average of 1,500 miles from farm to plate. Transportation and food waste combined create massive carbon footprints—vertical farming cuts these emissions by up to 70% [1]. Meanwhile, extreme weather destroyed 40% of California's lettuce crop in 2024, sending prices up 300% overnight. Grocery stores face identical problems: empty shelves during supply chain disruptions, \$162 billion in annual food waste, and customers demanding local, pesticide-free produce they can't reliably source. The Swedish chain ICA started building farms inside stores because traditional supply chains kept failing [3].

## The Solution

The magic happens when a restaurant installs our 6x8 foot growing module in their basement. Within 14 days, they're harvesting 200 pounds of greens monthly—enough to eliminate external sourcing. Our spectrum-tuned LEDs cut energy use by 40% while producing 3x yields per square foot versus traditional farming [4]. The AI-driven monitoring adjusts nutrients and lighting automatically. One Brooklyn restaurant cut produce costs 70% and eliminated waste entirely—greens go from harvest to plate in 10 minutes. Our pilot with Sweetgreen showed 99% reduction in transportation losses and 80% water savings [1]. The system pays for itself in 18 months through eliminated waste and transport costs.

## Market Size

The vertical farming market hit \$5.6 billion in 2024 and will reach \$13.7 billion by 2029, growing at 19.7% CAGR [5]. Bottom-up: 650,000 US restaurants spending \$4,000/month on produce = \$31 billion opportunity. Add 38,000 grocery stores at \$20,000/month = \$9 billion more. The hyperlocal segment specifically is exploding—30% of urban restaurants will operate vertical farms by 2026 [3]. Recent LED cost drops of 80% finally make unit economics work [4]. North America commands 41% market share, and building-based farming crossed \$4.1 billion in 2024 [2].

## Business Model

Hardware: \$45,000 per module (60% gross margin). Software subscription: \$299/month for monitoring and optimization. Average restaurant installs 2 modules = \$90,000 upfront + \$7,200 annual recurring revenue. CAC: \$5,000 through restaurant trade shows. LTV: \$126,000 over 5 years. That's a 25:1 LTV/CAC ratio. Path to \$100M: 200 installations year 1, 1,000 year 2, 3,000 year 3. Comparable: Toast started with restaurant hardware+SaaS and hit \$2.7 billion revenue by year 10.

## Why Now?

LED efficiency breakthrough in 2024: spectrum-tuned systems now deliver 40% energy savings, making vertical farming finally profitable [4]. Five years ago, energy costs killed every attempt—LEDs consumed 65% of operating expenses. Today, that's down to 25%. Renewable integration further drops costs to grid parity. Meanwhile, climate disasters increased 300% since 2020, making local production essential. The holy shit moment: Plenty raised nearly \$1 billion at a \$1.9 billion valuation before filing for bankruptcy in March 2025, creating a massive market vacuum while proving the tech works—they just targeted the wrong customers [6]. We're capturing the small-format opportunity they ignored.

## Competition & Moat

Infarm raised \$600 million for supermarket farms but filed for restructuring in 2024—they burned cash on R&D instead of revenue [6]. AeroFarms emerged from bankruptcy selling only to distributors, missing the direct-to-restaurant opportunity. Plenty collapsed chasing mega-farms when restaurants wanted micro-farms. Our advantage: turnkey simplicity. Competitors require 10,000+ square feet; we need 50. Our modular design costs 90% less to install. We own the restaurant relationships through our maintenance contracts, creating 36-month switching costs. Network effects kick in as restaurants share growing data, improving yields for everyone. Big Tech won't compete—Google tried farming in 2015 and quit. Amazon wants to sell produce, not growing systems.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Energy costs could spike, killing profitability. Mitigation: Our systems include solar integration options, and we're locking in 10-year renewable energy contracts. Restaurant adoption might stall. Mitigation: We're offering lease-to-own at \$1,500/month, removing upfront costs. Technical complexity might overwhelm operators. Mitigation: Our service team handles everything remotely; restaurants just harvest. Why hasn't Sysco done this? They make 28% margins on distribution—local growing kills their business model. The hidden risk everyone misses: local health regulations. We've pre-certified our systems in 30 states.

## Milestones

- 30 days: 10 paid pilots with NYC restaurants (\$450K committed revenue)
- 90 days: \$50K MRR from 20 installations plus subscriptions
- 6 months: \$250K MRR, 100 active systems, Series A conversations
- 12 months: \$1M ARR, 300 installations, profitability in sight
