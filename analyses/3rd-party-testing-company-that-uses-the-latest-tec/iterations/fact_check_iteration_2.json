        "evidence": "The Consumer Reports website returned a 403 error preventing verification, though the general claim about one-third of chocolate products is widely reported.",
        "suggestion": "Consider adding an alternative accessible source or noting that the specific Hershey's 125% figure needs additional verification."

These are critical factual errors that undermine the analysis credibility. The document needs revision to either provide accurate citations or remove these unsupported claims."
