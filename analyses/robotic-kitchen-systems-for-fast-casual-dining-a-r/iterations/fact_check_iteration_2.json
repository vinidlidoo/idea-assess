      "claim": "Nala Robotics just deployed fully autonomous kitchens at universities",

      "severity": "Medium",
      "details": {
        "issue_type": "false_citation",

        "explanation": "The analysis claims deployments are complete, but the source indicates they are still 'in process' of setting up.",
        "evidence": "Press release states they are 'in the process of setting its first 24-hour multicuisine fully robotic campus restaurant' at UNT, not that it's already deployed.",
        "suggestion": "Change 'just deployed' to 'is deploying' or 'plans to deploy' to accurately reflect the in-progress status."

      "claim": "hospitality maintaining 80% annual turnover",
      "section": "The Problem",

        "citation_ref": "none",
        "url_checked": "https://www.7shifts.com/blog/true-cost-of-employee-turnover/",
        "explanation": "Minor discrepancy: cited source states 79.6% turnover, analysis rounds to 80%.",
        "evidence": "Source actually states 79.6% average turnover rate for restaurants, with QSR at 123%.",
        "suggestion": "Either cite the exact 79.6% figure or add citation [3] to support this claim."

        "explanation": "Minor wording issue: source says 'reduced employment' not 'disappeared', though the number is correct.",
        "evidence": "Article confirms 18,000 job reduction but frames it as employment reduction, not jobs disappearing.",
        "suggestion": "Rephrase to 'employment reduced by 18,000' for more accurate representation."

  "iteration_reason": "The analysis contains mostly accurate citations with only one medium-severity issue (Nala Robotics deployment status) and two minor discrepancies. The core market data, financial projections, and competitive analysis are well-supported. The issues found are easily correctable and don't undermine the fundamental business case."
