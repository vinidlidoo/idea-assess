        "explanation": "The cited source page could not be accessed properly to verify the 36% labor cost claim. The $20 minimum wage is well-documented but the specific 36% figure needs verification.",

        "evidence": "No reference found in citation [3] or elsewhere for this specific number",
        "suggestion": "Add proper citation for the 858,000 open positions claim or remove if unverifiable"

These are significant factual claims that affect the credibility of the problem statement. The analysis would benefit from finding proper citations or adjusting these claims."
