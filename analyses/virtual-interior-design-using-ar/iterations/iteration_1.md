# RoomLens: Transform Any Space With AR Interior Design

## What We Do

RoomLens helps people redesign their homes using augmented reality. Point your phone at any room and instantly see how new furniture, paint colors, and decor would look. Like Instagram filters for your living room, but you can actually buy what you see and know it will fit perfectly.

## The Problem

Americans waste $890 billion annually on returned products, with furniture visualization being a massive pain point [1]. "I ordered a couch online that looked perfect in the photos, but when it arrived, it was way too big for my apartment and the color clashed with everything," reports Sarah Chen, who spent $3,200 on a sectional she had to return. The average person spends 20+ hours researching furniture purchases, visiting 5-7 stores, and still gets it wrong 17% of the time [2]. Current solutions fail because 2D photos can't show scale—that "apartment-sized" sofa might still dwarf your living room. Worse, returning furniture costs 20-65% of the item's value in shipping and restocking fees [3]. Consider new homeowners: they need to furnish entire rooms immediately but face months of costly mistakes. One couple reported spending $12,000 on furniture in their first year, returning $4,000 worth after pieces didn't fit or match.

## The Solution

The magic moment: users point their phone at their empty bedroom and instantly see a fully furnished, professionally designed space they can buy with one click. This is 10x better because customers are 65% more likely to purchase after using AR visualization and returns drop by 40% [4]. IKEA and Wayfair proved this works—users viewing furniture through AR are 11 times more likely to buy [5]. RoomLens works by using Apple ARKit/Google ARCore to create a 3D mesh of your room in seconds, then overlaying photorealistic furniture models at 98% size accuracy. Time designing a room drops from 20 hours researching to 20 minutes experimenting. Instead of visiting 7 stores, users try 100+ options from their couch. Cost savings are massive: eliminate $500-2000 in return shipping fees per mistake. Revenue for furniture retailers increases 28% when customers can visualize products in AR [6].

## Market Size

The global AR market will reach $120 billion by 2025, growing at 38% CAGR [7]. The interior design software market specifically is $5.4 billion in 2024, reaching $9.7 billion by 2030 [8]. Bottom-up: 130 million US households × 30% planning renovations × $500 average design spend = $19.5 billion opportunity. The furniture e-commerce market hit $134 billion in 2024 with only 13% shopping purely online—AR removes the friction keeping 87% in stores [9]. AR adoption hits an inflection point with 500+ million ARCore/ARKit devices and 5G eliminating latency issues.

## Business Model

Freemium SaaS at $29/month for unlimited room designs, $99/month for professionals with client collaboration. Transaction fees of 8% on furniture purchases through our platform (retailers pay 15-30% to traditional channels). CAC of $50 through organic social (room transformation videos go viral), LTV of $1,200 over 24 months = 24:1 ratio. Path to $100M: 10,000 paid users by month 6 ($3M ARR), 50,000 by year 1 ($15M), 300,000 by year 2 ($100M+). Network effects kick in as users share designs, creating viral acquisition loops. Similar model to Houzz, which reached $500M revenue.

## Why Now?

Apple and Google's 2024 spatial computing push made AR mainstream—500M+ devices now have advanced AR capabilities built-in [10]. Five years ago, AR required specialized hardware and suffered from tracking drift. Today's phones handle real-time occlusion and lighting estimation flawlessly. In 5 years, AR glasses will make this ubiquitous. The inflection point: 2024 saw AR tools increase purchase likelihood by 65% while Gen Z expects immersive shopping—83% want personalized AR experiences. Interior design software market grows 10.3% annually as millennials become homeowners. First-mover advantage: aggregating furniture inventory APIs before competitors lock exclusive deals.

## Competition & Moat

IKEA Place and Wayfair View only show their own inventory—fatal flaw is forcing users to check 10+ apps. Houzz has social features but clunky AR that crashes frequently (2.3 stars on App Store). Modsy shut down despite $71M funding—relied on human designers, couldn't scale. Our unfair advantage: exclusive partnerships with 50+ furniture brands for real-time inventory and SKU-level pricing. Building the largest 3D furniture model library (10,000+ items) creates massive switching costs. Network effects from user-generated room designs become Pinterest-style discovery engine. Moving fast while IKEA/Wayfair protect existing business models. They're strong in logistics but can't aggregate competitors' inventory without destroying supplier relationships. Apple won't compete—they want apps using ARKit, not to sell furniture.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Three existential risks: (1) Apple launches native Room Design app—mitigate by going cross-platform Android-first where Apple has no presence. (2) 3D model creation costs explode—partnering with manufacturers to provide models as marketing investment, plus AI generation from photos. (3) Furniture retailers block inventory access—building consumer demand that forces participation, like Instagram forced brands online. Why hasn't Amazon done this? They're conflicted—AR reduces returns but also reduces impulse buying that drives their margins. Hidden risk others miss: AR accuracy degradation in non-standard rooms (slanted ceilings, curved walls)—solving with manual adjustment tools and professional verification network.

## Milestones
