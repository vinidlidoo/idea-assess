# Roomcraft AR: Virtual Interior Design Platform Using Augmented Reality

## What We Do

Roomcraft AR lets homeowners visualize furniture and decor in their actual spaces before buying. Point your phone at any room, instantly see how that $2,000 sofa looks in your living room, test different configurations, and purchase directly through partner retailers.

## The Problem

People spend $650 billion annually on home furnishings globally, yet 70% of furniture buyers report anxiety about whether pieces will fit or look right in their space. The average furniture return costs retailers $150 in logistics and damages their unit economics. 

Current solutions fail because: physical showrooms only display 5% of available inventory, 2D room planners can't capture real lighting and proportions, and measuring tape gymnastics lead to costly mistakes. One customer told us: "I bought a sectional that looked perfect online. It blocked my entire walkway. Returning it cost me $400 and took three weeks."

This is a hair-on-fire problem for anyone moving homes - they need to furnish quickly but can't afford expensive mistakes. The average person moves 11 times in their lifetime, creating recurring acute need.

## The Solution

Users download our app, scan their room in 30 seconds using their phone camera, then browse a catalog of 50,000+ furniture items from partner retailers. Our AR engine renders photorealistic 3D models that respond to actual room lighting and shadows.

The magic moment: seeing that West Elm coffee table in YOUR living room, not a staged photo. Users can walk around it, test different positions, swap colors instantly. We're 10x better because we eliminate the imagination gap - what you see is exactly what you'll get.

Early pilots with 500 beta users show: 85% reduction in return rates, 3.2x higher conversion rates than traditional e-commerce, average session time of 24 minutes (vs 3 minutes for furniture sites). Our computer vision accurately maps rooms within 2cm tolerance, better than any competitor.

Users save 8+ hours of shopping time and avoid average return costs of $200. Retailers increase conversion by 3x and slash return processing costs by 85%.

## Market Size

The global furniture market reached $650 billion in 2024, growing at 5.2% annually [1]. AR-enabled commerce is exploding - 250 million people used AR shopping features in 2024, up from 100 million in 2022 [2].

Bottom-up: 80 million US households move or renovate annually. At $99/year subscription plus 8% affiliate commission on $3,000 average furniture spend, that's $27 billion addressable market in the US alone.

The AR commerce market specifically is projected to hit $120 billion by 2026, with furniture being the #2 category after fashion. Major retailers are desperately seeking AR solutions - IKEA's Place app has 15 million downloads but limited SKU coverage. This creates massive partnership opportunities.

## Business Model

We charge consumers $99/year for unlimited AR visualization plus exclusive discounts. Retailers pay us 8% commission on referred sales plus $50,000/year for enterprise analytics dashboard showing user engagement metrics.

Unit economics: CAC of $45 through targeted social media (people actively searching furniture get ads), LTV of $580 (24-month average retention Ã— $99 subscription + $200 commission revenue). 75% gross margin after infrastructure costs.

Path to $100M ARR: 400,000 paid subscribers ($40M) + 200 retail partners ($10M) + $50M in affiliate commissions. Based on Houzz's growth curve, this requires 18 months from launch with 50,000 monthly user additions.

Our killer metric: users who complete one AR session convert to paid at 42% within 7 days - 20x higher than typical freemium SaaS.

## Why Now?

ARKit 6 and ARCore 1.30 (released 2024) finally enable sub-centimeter spatial mapping accuracy on standard phones - impossible before due to hardware limitations. iPhone 15 Pro's LiDAR reaches 97% of rooms accurately versus 60% two years ago.

Five years ago: AR required $1,000+ dedicated headsets, spatial mapping was primitive, and 3D model creation cost $500+ per SKU. Today: every smartphone works, AI generates 3D models from photos for $0.50, and consumers are AR-native from Pokemon Go and Snapchat filters.

In five years this will be table stakes for all furniture retail. The race is on now. Google reports AR commerce interactions increased 500% in 2024. Major retailers are committing billions - Walmart acquired AR startup Zeekit, Amazon launched Room Decorator, but neither has cracked the furniture vertical effectively.

## Competition & Moat

Direct competitors: IKEA Place (15M users, limited to IKEA inventory), Houzz (50M users, $4B valuation, but AR is secondary feature), Modsy (shut down 2023 despite $73M raised - focused on human designers not AR).

Our unfair advantage: proprietary computer vision model trained on 2 million room scans that handles challenging conditions (mirrors, windows, unusual layouts) where competitors fail. We're also retailer-agnostic while others are locked to single brands.

Defensibility comes from network effects - more users provide more room data, improving our AI, attracting more retailers, expanding catalog, drawing more users. Switching costs are high once users have saved room scans and wishlists.

We'll win through speed - launching with 10 major retail partners in Q1 2025 while competitors negotiate one at a time. IKEA Place still only covers 20% of their catalog after 5 years. We'll have 50,000 SKUs on day one through our automated 3D model pipeline.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Apple/Google platform risk**: They could lock down AR APIs or launch competing features. Mitigation: Building WebAR fallback, partnering directly with retailers who have leverage, maintaining multi-platform approach.

**3D content creation bottleneck**: Scaling to millions of SKUs is challenging. Mitigation: AI-powered 3D generation from 2D images (currently 85% accurate), partnership with 3D scanning services, crowdsourced modeling marketplace.

**Consumer AR adoption**: People might not trust AR for major purchases. Mitigation: Accuracy guarantee with free returns if items don't match AR preview, social proof through user-generated AR rooms, influencer partnerships showing real results.

Why hasn't Wayfair or Amazon solved this? They're focused on broad e-commerce logistics, not deep AR technology. Their attempts (Amazon Room Decorator) are feature additions, not core products. We're AR-first with furniture as the perfect use case.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 1,000 beta users completing room scans, 3 signed retail partnership LOIs
**90 days**: 10,000 MAU, $50K MRR, 20 retail partners live
**6 months**: 50,000 paid subscribers, $500K MRR, Series A metrics achieved
**12 months**: 200,000 paid users, $2M MRR, expand to home improvement vertical
