# RoomCraft: Virtual Interior Design Using AR

## What We Do

RoomCraft lets you redesign any room instantly using your phone's camera. Point at your space, drag and drop real furniture from major retailers, see it in actual size with accurate lighting. Buy what you love directly through the app.

## The Problem

Furniture returns cost Americans $16.5 billion annually, with 30% of online furniture purchases returned because "it didn't look right in my space" [1]. The average person spends 63 hours researching furniture purchases, visiting 7+ stores, and still gets it wrong. One user told us: "I bought a $3,000 sectional that looked perfect online. It blocked my entire living room. Returning it cost me $400 in shipping and took 3 weeks."

Current solutions fail because measuring tapes lie, 2D room planners can't show depth, and "augmented reality" apps from retailers only show their own products in isolation. People need to see their entire room transformed, with multiple brands, accurate scale, and real lighting - before spending thousands.

## The Solution

Users scan their room in 30 seconds. Our AI identifies walls, windows, and existing furniture, creating a precise 3D model. They browse 2 million products from 500+ retailers, dragging items directly into their space. The magic: everything appears at exact scale with photorealistic rendering that matches their room's actual lighting.

First-time users redesign a room in under 5 minutes versus 3+ hours with traditional tools. Our pilots with 1,000 beta users showed 73% made a purchase within 48 hours (average order: $1,847), with returns dropping to 4% - an 87% reduction. The killer feature: our "Style Match" AI suggests complete room designs based on a single piece they like, maintaining their budget constraints.

## Market Size

The global furniture market reaches $765 billion in 2024, growing at 5.1% annually [2]. Our addressable market - digitally-influenced furniture purchases in developed countries - represents $180 billion. With 67 million Americans moving annually and 42% redecorating at least one room per year, we have 147 million potential room redesigns yearly.

At $29/month subscription plus 8% affiliate commission (average $147/purchase), 1 million users generate $350M ARR. The AR visualization market specifically grows at 43% CAGR, reaching $25 billion by 2028.

## Business Model

We charge $29/month for unlimited room designs, plus 8% affiliate commission on purchases (furniture retailers pay 10-15% standard). Average customer generates $47/month: $29 subscription + $18 commission (based on $2,250 annual furniture spend).

CAC is $37 through Instagram/Pinterest ads targeting "home decor" interests. LTV reaches $1,128 (24-month average retention), giving us 30:1 LTV/CAC. Gross margins hit 82% after AWS and API costs. Path to $100M: 150K subscribers by month 18, 400K by month 30. We're already at 11K paid users after 3 months.

## Why Now?

iPhone 12+ and Android 10+ devices (78% of smartphones) now have LiDAR/depth sensors enabling accurate room scanning. ARCore/ARKit improvements in 2024 finally enable stable, multi-object placement. Furniture e-commerce jumped from 12% to 34% market share during COVID and hasn't retreated.

The average American now spends 4.5 hours daily on their phone - they'll design rooms while watching TV, not visiting showrooms. Generative AI (launched 2023) lets us create photorealistic renders in real-time for $0.03/room versus $50+ for professional software. IKEA's AR app hit 47 million downloads but only shows IKEA products - proving demand while highlighting the opportunity.

## Competition & Moat

Modsy raised $72M but shut down - they required professional designers ($159/room) making unit economics impossible. Houzz has AR but focuses on contractors, not DIY ($40B GMV but only $500M revenue). IKEA/Wayfair/Target apps only show their own inventory.

Our unfair advantage: we're the only platform aggregating multiple retailers' inventory with accurate AR. Our proprietary "Dimension Match" API ingests product data from 500+ sources, standardizing measurements and materials. Retailers can't build this - they won't show competitors. Aggregators can't build this - they lack AR expertise.

Network effects kick in as users share room designs (23% viral coefficient), and our AI improves with each design created (now 4M+ rooms in training data).

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1:** Apple/Google could build this. **Mitigation:** They don't sell furniture or take affiliate fees - we're their ideal app showcase, not competition.

**Risk 2:** Furniture retailers could block our affiliate access. **Mitigation:** We drive 4x higher conversion than their own sites - we're their best channel. Plus we're building direct relationships with manufacturers.

**Risk 3:** Technology adoption by 45+ demographic. **Mitigation:** Our "Design Advisor" mode works through simple photos without AR. This segment represents 40% of furniture spending but only needs basic features.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Launch Android version, hit 25K total users
**90 days**: Integrate 3 major retailers directly (bypassing affiliate networks)
**6 months**: $2M ARR, Series A metrics achieved
**12 months**: 150K paid subscribers, $8M ARR, profitable unit economics
