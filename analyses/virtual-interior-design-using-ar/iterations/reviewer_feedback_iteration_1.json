  "iteration_recommendation": "reject",
  "iteration_reason": "Three critical issues must be addressed: (1) Beta user metrics need larger sample size or statistical validation, (2) The 42% conversion rate claim needs substantiation or revision, (3) The '2 million room scans' training data claim needs clarification. Additionally, several important improvements would strengthen the business case, particularly around CAC justification and SKU pipeline details."
