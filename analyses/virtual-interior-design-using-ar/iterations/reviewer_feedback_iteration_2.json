  "overall_assessment": "Significant improvement from iteration 1. Strong concrete metrics from beta testing, compelling TAM calculation, and specific unit economics. Still needs stronger competitive differentiation and more concrete evidence of technical moat.",
  "strengths": [
    "Excellent beta testing data with 2,100 users showing 85% return reduction and 3.2x conversion improvement",
    "Strong bottom-up TAM calculation: 80M households × ($99 + 8% of $3,000) = $27B",
    "Specific unit economics: CAC $125, LTV $580, 75% gross margin",
    "Clear 10x improvement articulated with concrete user benefit (8+ hours saved, $200 return costs avoided)",
    "Good use of 2024 data and credible references (8 citations from reputable sources)",
    "Compelling 'hair on fire' example with $400 sectional return story"
