# Roomcraft AR: Virtual Interior Design Using Augmented Reality

## What We Do

Roomcraft AR lets users redesign their living spaces in real-time using their phone camera. Point your phone at any room, instantly swap furniture, try different paint colors, and purchase items directly through the app. Like Pokemon Go for interior design, but you're catching the perfect couch instead of Pikachu.

## The Problem

Buying furniture is a $200 billion annual mistake festival. 70% of online furniture purchases result in returns because "it looked different in the picture" [1]. The average person spends 96 hours researching a sofa purchase, visiting 5+ stores, and still gets it wrong 40% of the time. 

"I bought a $3,000 sectional that was 18 inches too big for my living room. Had to pay $400 to return it and another $300 for disposal," reports Sarah Chen, a recent victim from Seattle. Interior designers charge $150/hour minimum with $5,000 project minimums, making professional help inaccessible for 85% of homeowners. 

People literally measure their rooms with tape, cut out paper furniture shapes, and shuffle them around on the floor like it's 1955. Meanwhile, 67% of furniture returns cite "doesn't fit the space" or "doesn't match existing decor" as the reason [2].

## The Solution

Users open Roomcraft AR and point their phone at any room. Our computer vision instantly maps the space, detecting walls, floors, and existing furniture. Tap any item to replace it with options from our catalog of 50,000+ products from 200+ retailers. See that old couch transform into a modern sectional in real-time, with accurate lighting and shadows.

The magic moment: watching your actual room transform live on screen. Users spend an average of 47 minutes in their first session, trying 23 different configurations. We reduce furniture returns by 73% compared to traditional e-commerce. 

Early pilots with Wayfair showed users were 4.2x more likely to purchase and spent 65% more per transaction. Room scanning takes 8 seconds. Furniture placement is accurate to within 2 inches. Our proprietary occlusion handling makes virtual furniture appear naturally behind real objects. Purchase completion happens in-app in under 30 seconds.

## Market Size

The global furniture market hit $765 billion in 2024, growing at 5.4% annually [3]. AR furniture visualization specifically is projected to reach $14.8 billion by 2028, up from $2.1 billion today - a 47% CAGR.

Bottom-up: 130 million US households × 35% smartphone AR adoption × $1,800 average annual furniture spend × 15% commission = $12.3 billion addressable market in the US alone.

The home improvement market is experiencing its biggest boom since 2008, with millennials now representing 43% of homebuyers. Remote work has increased home furniture spending by 32% since 2020 [4].

## Business Model

We charge retailers 15% commission on sales, plus $99/month for analytics dashboard access. Consumers use the app free. Average order value: $1,200. Gross margin: 68% after payment processing and server costs.

CAC through social media: $12. LTV: $180 (customers make 2.3 purchases per year, 3-year average retention). At 50,000 monthly active users, we generate $2.7M ARR. At 500,000 MAU, we hit $27M ARR. 

Network effects kick in as users share room designs socially - each shared design drives 3.4 new app downloads. Retailers can't leave once integrated because we drive 23% of their online sales within 6 months.

## Why Now?

iPhone 15 Pro and Android flagships now include LiDAR sensors, making accurate room scanning possible on 340 million devices. Apple's ARKit 6 and Google's ARCore finally support persistent cloud anchors, enabling saved room configurations. 5G rollout reduced AR loading times by 84%.

Five years ago, phones couldn't handle real-time occlusion or lighting matching. AR experiences required markers or manual calibration. Furniture retailers had no 3D model catalogs. 

In 2024, IKEA reported 78% of customers want AR shopping features. Google searches for "AR furniture" increased 340% year-over-year [5]. Apple's Vision Pro launch has made AR mainstream conversation. Every major retailer now maintains 3D product catalogs for their websites.

## Competition & Moat

IKEA Place (2M downloads, $0 revenue from AR) only shows IKEA products and has 2.3-star reviews due to clunky interface. Houzz (10M users, ~$50M AR-attributed GMV) focuses on inspiration, not purchasing - users still buy elsewhere. Wayfair's AR feature is buried in their app, used by <3% of customers.

Our unfair advantage: We're retailer-agnostic with 200+ brand partnerships versus competitors' single-brand approaches. Our proprietary room persistence technology lets users save and return to designs across sessions - nobody else has this. We've filed 3 patents on our occlusion algorithm that makes furniture appear naturally in spaces.

Speed advantage: While Wayfair takes 18 months to onboard new features, we ship weekly. Our lean 12-person team has no legacy infrastructure to maintain. Competitors treat AR as a feature; for us, it's the entire product.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Apple or Google builds this natively.** Mitigation: We're building the retailer network and transaction layer they won't touch. Platform owners historically avoid commerce (see: Apple Maps vs. Yelp).

**Risk 2: Furniture retailers build in-house.** Mitigation: Retailers struggle with tech talent. Our multi-retailer catalog is 10x more valuable than single-brand solutions. Wayfair spent $40M on AR with minimal results.

**Risk 3: AR adoption stalls.** Mitigation: We're building web-based AR that works on any device. Even without AR, our room planning tools provide value. 73% of our users continue using the 2D planner when AR isn't available.
