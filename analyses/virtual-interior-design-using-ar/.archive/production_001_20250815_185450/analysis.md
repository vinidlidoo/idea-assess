# RoomCraft: Virtual Interior Design Using AR

## What We Do

RoomCraft transforms any room instantly using AR on your phone. Point your camera at your space and watch furniture, paint, and decor appear in real-time - like Snapchat filters for your empty rooms, but you can buy what you see.

## The Problem

Interior design is fundamentally broken. The average homeowner spends 47 hours researching furniture purchases, visits 8 stores, and still returns 30% of items because they don't look right in their space [1]. One customer told us: "I bought a $3,000 couch that looked perfect online. When it arrived, it was too big for my doorway and the color clashed with everything. I ate the $400 return shipping."

Professional designers charge $5,000-15,000 per room, putting them out of reach for 92% of homeowners [2]. DIY alternatives force users to measure manually, guess at color matching, and imagine how pieces work together. Current apps like Houzz require uploading photos and waiting for processing - by the time you get results, you've lost the inspiration. Q4 2024 earnings calls revealed the crisis: Wayfair reported $1.4 billion in return-related losses, while Williams-Sonoma cited returns as their biggest margin killer at 34% of online furniture sales [3].

## The Solution

Open RoomCraft, point your phone at any room, and watch it transform in real-time. Our spatial mapping creates a 3D model in under 2 seconds. Browse 500,000+ furniture items from 200 retailers - each piece appears exactly to scale in your actual room with accurate lighting and shadows. The magic moment: sliding your finger to instantly swap between 10 different sofas, seeing exactly how each fits.

Here's the 10x proof: Traditional process takes 47 hours research, generates 30% returns costing $450 average. RoomCraft: 30 minutes total, 4% returns, $0 return cost. That's 94x faster with 87% fewer returns - a true 10x improvement in both time and money. Our 500 beta users report saving 38 hours per room and averaging only 4% returns versus industry standard 30%. Our proprietary light-matching algorithm ensures colors appear exactly as they will in your specific lighting - validated by colorimeter testing showing 96% accuracy versus 41% for photos.

## Market Size

The global furniture market reached $689 billion in early 2025, with online furniture sales at $267 billion growing 22% annually [4]. AR-enabled commerce exploded after Apple's Vision Pro launch - January 2025 data shows 71% of consumers now expect AR shopping experiences, driving 94% higher conversion rates [5].

Bottom-up: 128 million US households × 20% planning room redesigns annually × $150 subscription = $3.8 billion addressable market. Add furniture commissions (8-15% on $2,400 average order) and we reach $8.7 billion TAM. Goldman Sachs' Q1 2025 report projects AR commerce hitting $175 billion by 2027, with furniture as the fastest-growing segment at 67% CAGR [6].

## Business Model

We charge $14.99/month or $119/year for unlimited designs. Furniture partnerships work on tiers: standard affiliates pay 8%, premium placement 12%, exclusive launches 15% plus $10K placement fees. Beta users average $2,400 in purchases generating $240 commission plus $120 subscription = $360 LTV.

Gross margin breakdown at 73%: $360 revenue minus $23 AWS hosting, $31 3D model amortization, $19 customer support, $24 payment processing = $263 gross profit per user. CAC through targeted social is $47. We need 32,000 subscribers for $1M ARR (achievable in 6 months based on 64% beta conversion). Path to $100M: 670,000 subscribers plus $130M annual commissions. IKEA's AR tool drives $1.8 billion in attributed sales - we capture the value they leave on the table.

## Why Now?

Three catalysts converged in Q1 2025: Apple's Vision Pro sold 3.2 million units in pre-orders, making spatial computing mainstream overnight [7]. iPhone 15/16 Pro's LiDAR now reaches 68% of our target market with hardware capable of precise room scanning. ARKit 7's January 2025 update introduced real-time occlusion handling - furniture now properly appears behind/in front of existing objects, solving AR's biggest UX problem.

Consumer behavior hit an inflection point: Accenture's February 2025 study found 67% of millennials won't buy furniture without AR visualization, up from 23% in 2019 [8]. The furniture return crisis peaked with UPS announcing 15% price increases specifically for furniture returns. Search volume for "AR furniture" jumped 420% after CES 2025's AR showcases. Cloud rendering costs dropped 78% in 24 months, making photorealistic AR finally unit-economic at $0.02 per session.

## Competition & Moat

IKEA Place (10M downloads, $0 direct revenue) only shows IKEA inventory. Houzz (45M users, ~$500M revenue) requires manual photo uploads - no real-time AR. Modsy burned $37M failing to scale human designers. Amazon's AR View maintains 2.3 stars due to sizing errors. Wayfair's 3-year AR initiative failed because they outsourced core tech to Threekit, losing control of the experience.

Our unfair advantages: Exclusive 3D model access from 200 furniture partners who won't share with Amazon (channel conflict). Patent-pending light-matching algorithm (2 years development, 96% color accuracy). Network effects as users share designs - each share drives 3.7 new signups. Speed advantage: launching with West Elm, CB2, and Article in March while competitors negotiate.

Why haven't giants solved this? Amazon prioritizes logistics over experience - AR doesn't fit their everything store model. Wayfair lacks technical DNA (2% of employees are engineers versus our 67%). We own our stack end-to-end while they rely on third-party solutions that can't integrate deeply enough.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Apple builds native furniture AR.** Mitigation: Apple earns 30% commission on our $14.99 subscriptions - that's $100M+ in pure services revenue at scale. Adding furniture would cannibalize their platform fees and compete with developers. Their services strategy depends on apps like ours succeeding.

**Risk 2: Retailers build their own.** Mitigation: West Elm spent $12M on AR with IBM and killed it after 18 months. Building our tech requires $15M+ and 2 years. We're their outsourced R&D at 1/10th the cost.

**Risk 3: 3D model creation bottleneck.** Mitigation: Our photogrammetry pipeline creates models in 6 minutes versus 3 hours manually. We're training synthetic data generation that will drop this to 30 seconds by Q3 2025. If established players could solve this, Wayfair wouldn't lose $1.4 billion annually on returns.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Launch with West Elm, CB2, Article - 1,000 paying users  
**90 days**: 10,000 MAU, $150K MRR, 50+ retail partnerships  
**6 months**: $1M ARR, Series A metrics matching Poplar's $8M ARR benchmark  
**12 months**: $12M ARR, 100K subscribers, expand to commercial spaces
