# RoomCraft: Virtual Interior Design Using AR

## What We Do

RoomCraft lets you redesign any room instantly using your phone's camera. Point your device at your space, and our AR technology overlays furniture, paint colors, and decor in real-time, showing exactly how items will look and fit before you buy.

## The Problem

Interior design is broken. The average homeowner spends 47 hours researching furniture purchases, visits 8 stores, and still returns 30% of items because they don't look right in their space [1]. One customer told us: "I bought a $3,000 couch that looked perfect online. When it arrived, it was too big for my doorway and the color clashed with everything. I ate the $400 return shipping."

Professional designers charge $5,000-15,000 per room, putting them out of reach for 92% of homeowners [2]. DIY alternatives force users to measure manually, guess at color matching, and imagine how pieces work together. Current apps like Houzz require uploading photos and waiting for processing - by the time you get results, you've lost the inspiration. People literally buy and return $62 billion in furniture annually because they can't visualize it properly [3].

## The Solution

Open RoomCraft, point your phone at any room, and watch it transform in real-time. Our spatial mapping creates a 3D model in under 2 seconds. Browse 500,000+ furniture items from 200 retailers - each piece appears exactly to scale in your actual room with accurate lighting and shadows. The magic moment: sliding your finger to instantly swap between 10 different sofas in your living room, seeing exactly how each fits.

We're 10x better because we eliminate guesswork entirely. Users report 73% fewer returns and save 38 hours per room redesign. Early pilots with 500 beta users showed 89% successfully redesigned a room within 30 minutes, spending an average of $2,400 on furniture with only 4% returns. Our proprietary light-matching algorithm ensures colors appear exactly as they will in your specific lighting conditions - something no competitor has solved.

## Market Size

The global furniture market hit $651 billion in 2024, with online furniture sales at $247 billion growing 18% annually [4]. AR-enabled commerce is exploding - 71% of consumers say they'd shop more frequently with AR, and AR experiences drive 94% higher conversion rates [5].

Bottom-up: 128 million US households × 20% planning room redesigns annually × $150 annual subscription = $3.8 billion addressable market. Add furniture affiliate commissions (8% on $2,400 average order value) and we reach $8.7 billion TAM. The AR commerce market specifically is projected to hit $120 billion by 2026, growing at 47% CAGR [6].

## Business Model

We charge $14.99/month or $119/year for unlimited room designs. Furniture purchases through our platform earn us 8-12% affiliate commissions. With beta users averaging $2,400 in purchases, we earn $192 in commissions plus $120 in subscription revenue = $312 LTV at 73% gross margin.

CAC through targeted social media is $47. At current conversion rates, we need 32,000 paying subscribers to hit $1M ARR (achievable in 6 months based on 500 beta users converting at 64%). Path to $100M: 670,000 subscribers + $130M in annual furniture commissions. IKEA's similar tool drives $1.4 billion in attributed sales - we capture value they leave on the table.

## Why Now?

Three technologies converged in 2024: iPhone 15 Pro's LiDAR reaches 65% of our target market, giving precise spatial mapping. ARKit 6's room-plan API now recognizes furniture and walls automatically - impossible before 2023. Cloud rendering costs dropped 78% in 24 months, making real-time photorealistic AR finally unit-economic.

Consumer behavior shifted permanently: 67% of millennials won't buy furniture without visualization tools, up from 23% in 2019 [7]. Furniture returns hit crisis levels - Wayfair loses $1.2 billion annually on returns. Retailers desperately need our solution. Apple's Vision Pro launch made AR mainstream - search volume for "AR furniture" increased 340% since February 2024 [8].

## Competition & Moat

IKEA Place (10M downloads, $0 revenue from app) only shows IKEA products. Houzz (45M users, ~$500M revenue) requires photo uploads and manual measurements - no real-time AR. Modsy shut down after burning $37M because their human-designer model couldn't scale. Amazon's AR View has terrible reviews (2.3 stars) due to inaccurate sizing.

Our unfair advantage: exclusive partnerships with 200 furniture retailers giving us 3D model access competitors can't get. Our patent-pending light-matching algorithm took 2 years to develop. Network effects kick in as users share room designs - each shared design drives 3.7 new signups. We're moving fast: launching with 3 major retailers in January while competitors negotiate with legal teams.

Competitors are strong at brand recognition but weak at actual AR execution. IKEA's app crashes 31% of the time according to app store reviews. We maintain 99.7% uptime with 1.3-second average load times.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Apple or Google builds this natively.** Mitigation: We're building the furniture marketplace layer they won't touch - they want app store revenue, not furniture commissions. We integrate deeply with retailers' inventory systems, creating switching costs.

**Risk 2: Furniture retailers build their own.** Mitigation: Retailers spend 2% of revenue on tech. Building our tech would cost $15M+. We're their outsourced R&D.

**Risk 3: 3D model creation bottleneck.** Mitigation: We've automated 3D capture using photogrammetry - creating models in 6 minutes vs. 3 hours manually. If Wayfair could do this, they wouldn't lose $1.2 billion on returns.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Launch with 3 furniture partners, 1,000 paying users
**90 days**: 10,000 MAU, $150K MRR, 50+ retail partnerships
**6 months**: $1M ARR, Series A metrics: 40% MoM growth, CAC < $50
**12 months**: $12M ARR, 100K subscribers, expand to commercial spaces
