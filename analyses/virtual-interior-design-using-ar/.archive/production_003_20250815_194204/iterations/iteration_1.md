# RoomCraft AR: Virtual Interior Design Platform Using Augmented Reality

## What We Do

RoomCraft AR lets you redesign any room instantly using your phone. Point your camera at your space, drag and drop real furniture from 10,000+ retailers, see it in actual size with accurate lighting, then buy it directly through the app.

## The Problem

Interior design failures cost Americans $47 billion annually in returned furniture and renovation mistakes [1]. "I ordered a couch that looked perfect online but it was 30% bigger than I expected and completely blocked my hallway," says Jennifer Martinez, who spent $3,200 on furniture that didn't fit. The average person spends 73 hours researching furniture purchases, visiting 8 stores, and still has a 22% return rate. Current solutions fail because: online photos lie about scale, measuring tapes can't visualize style combinations, hired designers cost $5,000+ minimum, and existing AR apps only show generic 3D models not actual purchasable products. Right now, Sarah Chen in Seattle needs to furnish her new condo by month-end but can't risk another $2,000 mistake after her dining table disaster.

## The Solution

Users open RoomCraft, scan their room (takes 8 seconds), and immediately see a 3D workspace. They browse real products from West Elm, CB2, Article—seeing exact items with current prices. Our spatial AI places furniture with millimeter precision, adjusting for walls, windows, and existing items. The magic moment: watching that $1,899 sectional appear in your actual living room, perfectly scaled, with shadows matching your lighting. Users save 67 hours of shopping time and reduce returns by 89%. Early beta users redesigned rooms 3.2x faster than traditional shopping. Our computer vision API processes 50,000 room scans daily with 99.4% accuracy, using Apple's RoomPlan and our proprietary object recognition trained on 2.3 million interior photos.

## Market Size

The US furniture and home decor market reached $235 billion in 2024, growing at 8.3% annually [2]. Bottom-up: 78 million US households planning redecorating × $3,100 average spend × 15% digital adoption = $36.3 billion addressable market. Online furniture sales specifically are exploding at 21% CAGR, reaching $97 billion by 2028. The AR commerce segment alone will hit $17 billion by 2026, with furniture as the #2 category after fashion. IKEA's AR app already drives $2.1 billion in sales, proving massive consumer appetite [3].

## Business Model

We charge retailers 8% commission on sales, undercutting traditional platforms' 15-20% rates. Average order value: $1,847. Customer acquisition cost: $31 through social media. Lifetime value: $892 (users make 3.7 purchases in year one). Gross margin: 72% after cloud costs. Path to $100M ARR: 10,000 daily active users by month 6 ($31M ARR), 35,000 by year end ($108M ARR). We also offer RoomCraft Pro at $29/month for unlimited high-res exports and commercial use. Network effects kick in as users share room designs socially, driving viral acquisition at near-zero CAC.

## Why Now?

Apple's RoomPlan API (launched June 2024) made instant 3D room scanning possible on 1.5 billion devices. Previously, LIDAR scanning required $3,000+ equipment. Furniture e-commerce hit an inflection point with 67% of millennials now buying furniture online versus 23% in 2019. AR processing costs dropped 94% since 2020—what cost $1,000/month now costs $60. New regulations requiring accurate size disclosure online (FTC Rule 2024) make our precision scanning essential for retailers. The average smartphone now has 8GB RAM, finally enough for smooth AR experiences. GenZ spends 4.2 hours daily in AR/camera apps, making this their native shopping interface [4].

## Competition & Moat

Houzz has 65 million users and $500M revenue but only shows inspiration photos, not AR placement. Modsy raised $73M but shut down—their $199 designer-led model couldn't scale. IKEA Place has 8 million downloads but only shows IKEA products, limiting usefulness. Wayfair's AR feature covers just 3% of inventory with low-quality generic models. Our unfair advantage: exclusive partnerships with 47 premium brands giving us first access to 3D models, reducing their photography costs by 60%. Our proprietary DesignMatch AI learns individual style preferences with 91% accuracy after 5 interactions. We process AR 4.8x faster using edge computing versus competitors' cloud-only approach. Moving fast, we'll have 100,000 products live before competitors can copy our retailer integration model. Users create personal room profiles that become switching costs—nobody wants to rescan for a competing app.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Apple or Google builds native solution.** Mitigation: Focus on commerce integration and retailer relationships they won't replicate. We're the transaction layer, not just the AR viewer. **Risk 2: Retailers build in-house.** Mitigation: Our multi-brand marketplace provides 10x more value than single-brand apps. **Risk 3: 3D model creation bottleneck.** Mitigation: Automated photogrammetry pipeline creates models from 8 photos in 3 minutes. Why BigCo hasn't done this: Amazon tried with AR View but failed because they focused on their own inventory, not partnering with premium brands where margins justify AR investment.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 500 beta users, 3 major retailer LOIs signed
**90 days**: 10,000 products live, $100K GMV achieved
**6 months**: $500K monthly revenue, Series A metrics hit
**12 months**: $9M ARR, 50 retailer partnerships, 100K monthly active users
