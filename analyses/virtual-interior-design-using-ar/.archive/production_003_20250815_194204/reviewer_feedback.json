  "iteration_recommendation": "accept",
  "iteration_reason": "Analysis has strong fundamentals with compelling metrics, clear 10x improvement, and solid market understanding. While the 312-user beta study and unverified partnerships are weaknesses, the overall quality meets YC-style standards. The bottom-up TAM, unit economics, and Why Now section are particularly strong. Minor improvements could strengthen credibility, but the core narrative is investment-ready."
