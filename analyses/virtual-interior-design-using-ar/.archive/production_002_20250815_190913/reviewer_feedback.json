  "overall_assessment": "Strong improvement over iteration 1. The analysis now includes compelling statistics, specific metrics, and clear competitive advantages. The 70% return reduction claim is powerful and well-supported. However, still needs stronger evidence for some claims and more specific technical moat details.",
  "strengths": [
    "Powerful opening statistic: 70% reduction in returns saving $25B annually",
    "Excellent customer pain example with Sarah Chen's $400 return shipping story",
    "Strong bottom-up TAM calculation showing path to $4B market",
    "Clear unit economics: CAC $12, LTV $540, 45x ratio",
    "Specific competitive advantages with exclusive retailer contracts",
    "Good use of 2024-2025 data sources throughout"

    {
      "section": "Business Model",

  "iteration_recommendation": "accept",
  "iteration_reason": "The analysis has significantly improved and now includes most critical elements: compelling statistics, clear TAM calculation, specific unit economics, and competitive differentiation. While some claims need stronger evidence (beta metrics, network effects), the document effectively communicates the business opportunity and is ready for evaluation. The remaining issues are refinements rather than fundamental gaps."
