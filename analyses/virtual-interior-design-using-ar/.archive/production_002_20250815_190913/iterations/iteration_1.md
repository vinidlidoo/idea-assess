# RoomCraft AR: Virtual Interior Design Platform Using Augmented Reality

## What We Do

RoomCraft AR lets you see exactly how furniture and decor will look in your actual room before buying. Point your phone at any space, instantly place virtual furniture from real retailers, and purchase directly through the app.

## The Problem

Buying furniture online is a $127 billion gamble. 73% of shoppers abandon carts because they can't visualize how items fit their space [1]. "I measured wrong and the sofa blocked my doorway - cost me $400 in return shipping," reports Sarah Chen from Austin. The average furniture return rate hits 30%, costing retailers $25 billion annually in logistics alone [2]. 

Customers spend 8+ hours researching a single purchase across Pinterest, retailer sites, and showrooms. They screenshot, measure, re-measure, create mood boards, and still get it wrong. Interior designers charge $150/hour minimum with 4-week lead times. Most people need help with one room, not a whole house. The middle market - people who want professional results without designer fees - has zero good options.

## The Solution

Open RoomCraft AR, scan your room in 10 seconds. Our AI instantly maps dimensions, lighting, and existing furniture. Browse 500,000+ real products from 200+ retailers, all rendered at exact scale in your actual space. Change colors, swap styles, walk around items in AR.

The magic moment: seeing that West Elm couch perfectly positioned in your living room, matching your rug, fitting exactly between your windows. No measuring tape, no guesswork. Early beta users make purchase decisions 85% faster and return 70% less merchandise [3]. 

Our proprietary depth-sensing algorithm achieves millimeter-accurate placement even on older phones. We pre-process retailer catalogs into optimized 3D models, reducing load time to under 2 seconds per item. Commission-based revenue means it's completely free for consumers.

## Market Size

The global AR market in retail will reach $18.8 billion by 2025, growing at 48% CAGR [4]. Home furnishing e-commerce specifically represents $340 billion globally, with AR adoption projected to hit 100 million users by 2026 [5].

Bottom-up: 87 million US households shop for furniture annually, spending average $2,400. If 15% adopt AR tools at our 8% commission rate, that's $2.5 billion addressable market in the US alone. Europe and Asia represent 3x this opportunity. Virtual staging for real estate (12 million listings annually) adds another $500 million TAM at $99/room pricing.

## Business Model

We charge retailers 8% commission on completed sales, roughly half their current return processing costs. Consumers use the platform free. Premium features ($9.99/month) include unlimited room saves, designer color palettes, and style recommendations.

CAC through SEO and retailer partnerships: $12. Average customer generates $180 in commissions year one (LTV $540 over 3 years). Gross margins hit 82% since we don't hold inventory. At 500K monthly active users, we generate $7.5M monthly recurring revenue. Path to $100M ARR requires 1.3 million active users - under 2% of annual furniture shoppers.

## Why Now?

Apple's ARKit and Google's ARCore now reach 1.5 billion devices with sub-centimeter accuracy [6]. This precision wasn't possible until 2023's updates. iPhone 15 Pro's LiDAR scanner creates room meshes in real-time - technology that cost $50,000 five years ago.

5G deployment enables instant loading of high-res 3D models. Furniture retailers lost $40 billion to returns in 2024, making them desperate for solutions. IKEA reported 50% sales increase for products with AR preview [7]. Consumer behavior shifted: 67% of millennials expect AR features when furniture shopping online. The infrastructure, demand, and technology finally aligned in late 2024.

## Competition & Moat

IKEA Place (2M downloads) only shows IKEA products. Wayfair's AR (5M users) has poor accuracy and limited catalog. Houzz's feature ($500M revenue) focuses on professionals, not consumers. Amazon's AR (launched 2024) lacks curation and style guidance.

Our advantages: exclusive 3-year contracts with West Elm, CB2, Article covering 200,000 SKUs competitors can't access. Our computer vision team from Apple Maps built room-scanning 10x faster than alternatives. Network effects compound - each room scanned improves our recommendation algorithm. Users save 12 room designs on average, creating switching costs.

We're partnering directly with Shopify's 2 million furniture merchants for instant catalog integration. Moving fast matters: every month ahead means 50,000 more exclusive SKUs and deeper retailer relationships.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Platform dependency**: Apple/Google could build native solutions. Mitigation: Focus on multi-retailer aggregation and style recommendations they won't build. Sign exclusive data partnerships now.

**3D content creation costs**: Manually modeling furniture is expensive. Mitigation: AI-powered photogrammetry creates 3D models from regular photos at $0.50/item versus $50 traditional cost.

**Consumer AR adoption**: Many haven't tried AR beyond filters. Mitigation: Partner with retailers for in-store demos, proven to drive 40% app installs.

If Amazon or Wayfair could solve this, they would have. They're constrained by legacy technical debt and can't aggregate competitors' catalogs. We're building retailer-agnostic from day one.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Launch with 10,000 SKUs, 100 beta users in San Francisco
**90 days**: 50,000 SKUs, 1,000 weekly active users, first $10K in commissions

**12 months**: 500,000 SKUs, 100,000 WAU, $1.5M MRR, Series A metrics achieved
