# Roomcraft AR: Virtual Interior Design Using Augmented Reality

## What We Do

Roomcraft AR lets homeowners redesign their spaces in real-time using augmented reality. Point your phone at any room, instantly swap furniture, change paint colors, and purchase everything you see - turning a 3-month design process into 30 minutes.

## The Problem

Homeowners waste $15,000 and 4 months on average making design mistakes during renovations [1]. Sarah Chen, a Bay Area tech worker, bought $3,000 worth of furniture that looked perfect online but was completely wrong in her space. "The couch was too big, the color clashed with my walls, and returning it cost me $400 in shipping," she says. This happens to 67% of online furniture buyers [2].

Current solutions fail spectacularly. Traditional interior designers charge $5,000-15,000 and take months. Online room planners use 2D layouts that don't show real scale or lighting. Pinterest boards create unrealistic expectations. Meanwhile, the average person moves 11 times in their lifetime and redesigns spaces every 5 years, creating repeated pain points worth billions in wasted purchases and time.

## The Solution

Users scan their room in 60 seconds using their phone's LiDAR sensor. Our AI instantly creates a 3D model accurate to 2cm. They browse real furniture from 500+ retailers, drag items into their actual space, and see exactly how everything looks with their lighting and wall colors. The magic moment: watching a $2,000 West Elm couch appear in your living room, perfectly scaled, before you buy it.

Early beta users report 85% fewer returns and complete room designs in 35 minutes versus 3 weeks traditionally [3]. We integrate directly with retailer APIs for real-time pricing and availability. Users save designs, share with family, and purchase everything through our platform. One pilot user redesigned her entire apartment for $8,000 - saving $4,000 by avoiding mistakes she would have made without AR visualization.

## Market Size

The global interior design software market reached $4.2B in 2024, growing at 19% annually [4]. More importantly, furniture e-commerce hit $257B with 73% of buyers wanting AR features before purchasing [5]. Our bottom-up math: 130 million US households × 30% planning renovations × $100 annual subscription = $3.9B addressable market.

The AR furniture visualization segment specifically is exploding from $800M to projected $4.5B by 2028 as Apple's Vision Pro and Meta's AR glasses mainstream spatial computing [6]. Every major retailer from IKEA to Wayfair is desperately seeking AR solutions.

## Business Model

We charge $9.99/month for unlimited room designs or $99/year. Professional tier at $49/month includes contractor connections and commercial-grade rendering. We also take 8-12% commission on furniture purchases through our platform, similar to Houzz's model.

Unit economics: $3 CAC through social media (before/after reveals go viral), $180 LTV on consumer subscriptions alone. Adding commerce commission brings LTV to $420. At 60% gross margins after cloud compute costs, we reach $100M ARR with just 550,000 subscribers - 0.4% of US households. IKEA's AR app already has 15 million downloads, validating massive demand [7].

## Why Now?

iPhone 12+ and iPad Pro's LiDAR sensors reached 200 million devices in 2024, providing accurate 3D scanning capability [8]. Cloud rendering costs dropped 70% since 2020 thanks to GPU competition. Furniture returns hit crisis levels - costing retailers $70B annually, making them desperate for AR solutions [9].

Five years ago, phones couldn't do accurate 3D scanning. Five years from now, everyone will shop furniture in AR. Amazon just invested $1B in AR shopping tech. Shopify made AR tools free for all merchants. The infrastructure finally exists - we're riding the wave as spatial computing goes mainstream. Google searches for "AR furniture" increased 400% in 2024 [10].

## Competition & Moat

Modsy raised $72M but shut down - they required professional designers and 7-day turnaround. Houzz has 65M users but only 2D planning tools. IKEA Place works only with IKEA furniture. Wayfair's AR shows single items, not complete room designs.

Our moat: we're the only platform combining instant LiDAR scanning, multi-retailer catalog (500+ brands), and one-click purchasing. Our proprietary AI trained on 2 million room designs optimizes layouts 10x faster than competitors. Network effects kick in as users share designs, creating a social layer competitors can't replicate. We move fast - shipping weekly while Houzz updates annually. Our 8-person team includes AR engineers from Apple and Magic Leap.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1**: Apple or Google builds native AR furniture tools. **Mitigation**: Partner with retailers who want platform-agnostic solutions. Apple takes 30% commission; we take 12%.

**Risk 2**: Furniture retailers build in-house. **Reality**: They've tried and failed. West Elm spent $10M on AR with poor results. They need us.

**Risk 3**: AR adoption slower than expected. **Mitigation**: Our 2D fallback mode works on any phone, converting to AR when users upgrade devices.

Why hasn't Amazon done this? They're focused on individual products, not room design. Their DNA is logistics, not creativity.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 1,000 beta users, 50% designing weekly
**90 days**: $50K MRR, 3 major retailer partnerships
**6 months**: $250K MRR, 25,000 active subscribers
**12 months**: $1M MRR, Series A metrics achieved
