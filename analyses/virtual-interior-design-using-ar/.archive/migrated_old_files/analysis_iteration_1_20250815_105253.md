# Roomly: Virtual Interior Design Using AR

## What We Do

Roomly transforms empty spaces into fully-furnished rooms instantly through your phone camera. Point your device at any room, select furniture from real retailers, see it placed perfectly to scale, then buy everything with one click. Like Pokemon Go but for interior design.

## The Problem

Moving into a new space is overwhelming. The average person spends 47 hours researching furniture, makes 3.2 costly sizing mistakes per room, and returns 23% of online furniture purchases because items don't fit or look different than expected [1]. Sarah, a tech worker who just signed a lease, told us: "I bought a $2,400 couch that looked perfect online. It blocked my entire hallway. The return cost me $400 in shipping."

Current solutions fail spectacularly. Physical showrooms only display 5% of available inventory. Online shopping shows flat images without context. Hiring designers costs $5,000-$15,000 per room. Free design tools require complex measurements and technical skills. Meanwhile, 67% of millennials move every 2-3 years, creating constant demand for furniture solutions that actually work.

## The Solution

Users scan their room in 8 seconds using our LiDAR-powered app. Our AI instantly maps dimensions, lighting, and architectural features, then suggests furniture combinations from 400+ retail partners that fit perfectly. The magic moment: seeing your actual empty bedroom transformed with a complete West Elm setup, accurate to the millimeter, in under 30 seconds.

We're 10x better because we eliminate guesswork entirely. Early beta users report 0% return rates (vs. industry average 23%), 91% faster decision-making, and average cart sizes of $3,400. Our proprietary spatial AI achieves 99.2% measurement accuracy compared to 78% for competitors using manual input [2]. Users see exactly how morning light hits that velvet chair, whether the coffee table blocks the TV view, and if that bookshelf fits under the window.

## Market Size

The global furniture market hit $741 billion in 2024, with online furniture sales growing 18% annually to reach $289 billion [3]. Our specific target: the $67 billion US online furniture market serving 44 million annual movers. With average furniture spending of $3,100 per move, our addressable market represents $136 billion in annual transaction volume.

AR commerce is exploding - growing 94% YoY with furniture as the #1 use case. IKEA's AR app drives $2.1 billion in sales. Yet penetration remains under 8%, leaving massive headroom for growth as smartphone AR capabilities reach 2.4 billion devices by 2025 [4].

## Business Model

We charge retailers 8% commission on completed sales (vs. 15-20% for traditional marketplaces). At $3,400 average order value, we net $272 per transaction. Our CAC through organic social is $34, delivering 8:1 LTV/CAC ratio. Retailers pay an additional $500/month for premium placement and analytics.

Path to $100M ARR: 2,000 transactions/month by month 6 ($6.5M ARR), 8,000 by month 12 ($26M ARR), 30,000 by month 24 ($98M ARR). With 44 million moves annually and 2.4 items purchased per move, capturing just 0.3% of transactions gets us there. Network effects kick in as more retailers join, increasing selection and conversion rates.

## Why Now?

Three technologies converged in 2024: iPhone 15 Pro's LiDAR scanner reached 50 million users, Web-based AR eliminated app download friction, and AI vision models achieved sub-centimeter accuracy. Five years ago, AR required $10,000 headsets and manual 3D modeling. Today, every flagship phone has professional-grade spatial computing.

The behavioral shift is staggering: AR usage jumped from 32 million to 110 million Americans in just two years [5]. Gen Z spends 8.5 hours weekly in AR experiences. Most critically, furniture retailers report that AR features increase conversion 94% and reduce returns 64%. The infrastructure finally exists - Shopify, Amazon, and Google all launched AR commerce APIs in 2024.

## Competition & Moat

Modsy raised $71M but shut down - they required professional designers and 2-week turnaround. Havenly ($52M raised) still relies on human designers at $79-199/room with 5-day waits. IKEA Place works only with IKEA inventory. Wayfair's AR shows single items, not complete rooms. Amazon's AR launched in 2024 but lacks design intelligence - it's just object placement.

Our unfair advantage: we're the only platform combining instant AI room design with multi-retailer inventory. Our spatial AI model, trained on 2.4 million room scans, understands design principles competitors ignore - traffic flow, focal points, proportion rules. We've secured exclusive AR integration deals with 12 major retailers representing $34B in inventory. Most critically, our one-click checkout across multiple retailers required 18 months of API integrations competitors can't replicate quickly.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Apple or Google enters directly.** Mitigation: We're building the transaction layer they won't touch - multi-retailer checkout, delivery coordination, white-glove setup. Platform owners historically avoid marketplace operations.

**Risk 2: Retailer partnerships dissolve.** Mitigation: No single retailer exceeds 15% of inventory. Our consumer app drives 3.4x higher conversion than retailers' own sites, making us indispensable.

**Risk 3: AR adoption stalls.** Mitigation: We're building parallel web experience using uploaded photos + AI. Already 31% of sessions use this fallback profitably.

Why hasn't Wayfair built this? They're constrained to their own inventory. Multi-retailer coordination requires neutral platform we provide.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 1,000 beta users, 50 completed room designs with 20%+ conversion
**90 days**: $500K GMV, 3 additional retailer partnerships signed
**6 months**: $2M monthly GMV, Series A metrics achieved
**12 months**: $8M monthly GMV, 25 retailer partnerships, 500K MAU
