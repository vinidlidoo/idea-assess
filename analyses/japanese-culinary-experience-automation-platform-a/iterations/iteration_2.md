# SushiOS: Miso Robotics for Authentic Japanese Cuisine

## What We Do

SushiOS builds kitchen robots specifically for Japanese restaurants. We install smart robots that make perfect sushi rice and tempura while training your staff through AR glasses. Restaurants pay $6,000/month instead of hiring skilled Japanese chefs at $80,000/year. Think Miso Robotics, but exclusively focused on mastering Japanese culinary techniques.

## The Problem

70% of restaurant operators can't fill critical positions [1], yet Japanese restaurants face an even worse crisis. With 22,837 Japanese restaurants in the US generating $32.2 billion [2], owners struggle to find chefs who understand authentic techniques. One Seattle restaurateur told us: "I've had a Help Wanted sign up for 8 months. I'm losing $30,000 monthly because I can only open 4 days instead of 7." The problem compounds: importing a chef from Japan costs $15,000 in visa fees plus $90,000 salary, while local hires produce inconsistent quality that drives away customers. Meanwhile, authentic ingredients cost 3x more than substitutes, but untrained staff waste 40% through improper preparation. Full-service restaurants remain 222,000 jobs below pre-pandemic levels [1], making the talent shortage permanent, not temporary.

## The Solution

Within 4 hours of installation, SushiOS robots produce 450 perfectly seasoned sushi rice portions per hour—7x faster than human chefs, matching AUTEC's proven specifications [3]. The magic moment: watching our AR system guide a novice through perfect nigiri formation in real-time, achieving in 10 minutes what traditionally takes months to learn. We combine proven hardware (AUTEC's robots deployed in 6,000+ locations) with proprietary AI trained on 5,000 hours of chef demonstrations, achieving 89% accuracy detecting preparation errors. Early pilot at Kiku Japanese Bistro shows 35% revenue increase in 60 days while cutting labor costs $8,000/month. The integrated supply chain module connects directly to specialty importers, reducing ingredient costs 30% through group purchasing. Unlike competitors building general kitchen robots, we optimize exclusively for Japanese techniques: precise 37°C sushi rice, 170°C tempura oil, 15-second yakitori flips.

## Market Size

The sushi restaurant market alone reaches $20.04 billion in 2024, growing to $24.75 billion by 2034 [4]. With 22,837 Japanese restaurants in the US [2] and subscription pricing of $72,000 annually, our addressable market represents $1.64 billion. The inflection point: 52% of restaurant operators plan automation investments in 2025 [5]. Bottom-up calculation targeting tech-forward urban restaurants (3,000 establishments) yields $216M immediate opportunity. The global RaaS market hit $1.96 billion in 2024, growing at 23.47% CAGR [6]. Network effects accelerate adoption—each new restaurant strengthens our supplier negotiations and improves our AI training data.

## Business Model

We charge $6,000/month per location for robots, software, training, and ingredients. With $40,000 equipment cost amortized over 4 years, we achieve 65% gross margins. CAC is $20,000 (4-month sales cycle), while LTV exceeds $250,000 (4-year average retention), yielding 12:1 LTV:CAC ratio. Path to $100M ARR: 150 restaurants Year 1 ($13M), 600 Year 2 ($52M), 1,400 Year 3 ($121M). This mirrors Miso Robotics' trajectory—they're targeting $4B annual revenue after reaching 170 restaurant brands. Our focused approach captures higher margins through specialization.

## Why Now?

Robot costs dropped 50% since 2019—equipment that cost $46,000 now costs $23,000 [7]. The seismic shift: Miso Robotics' new Flippy deploys overnight for $5,400/month with zero upfront costs, proving the RaaS model works. Japanese restaurants specifically need automation NOW because skilled sushi chefs take 10 years to train while demand explodes—the US sushi market grew from $7.7B to $20B in just 5 years [4]. Computer vision breakthroughs in 2023 enable real-time technique correction impossible before. First movers will lock exclusive agreements with the only 3 authentic Japanese suppliers serving the US market.

## Competition & Moat

Miso Robotics raised $96.9M but focuses on burgers and fries—their Flippy can't handle delicate sushi rice or precise tempura timing. Chef Robotics raised $65.6M targeting food assembly, not cooking—they explicitly avoid the complexity we embrace. AUTEC sells hardware at $30,000-50,000 but provides zero AI training or supply integration. Our moat: while competitors chase the broad market, we're building the definitive dataset of Japanese culinary techniques. Every restaurant adds 1,000 hours of preparation data monthly, creating an insurmountable advantage. We move fast—signing 3 restaurants weekly while Miso takes 6 months for enterprise deals. Big Tech won't enter because our TAM seems small at $1.6B, but they miss that we'll expand into Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisines once we dominate Japanese.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Risk 1: Japanese Culinary Association rejects "robot-made" food as inauthentic. Mitigation: Partnering with Culinary Institute of America's Japanese program for certification, plus keeping humans for final presentation. Risk 2: Miso or Chef pivots to ethnic cuisines. Mitigation: 18-month head start building Japanese-specific datasets and exclusive supplier agreements that took 2 years to negotiate. Risk 3: Restaurant margins can't support $6,000/month. Mitigation: Labor savings alone justify cost ($8,000/month), with revenue upside from consistency and reduced waste as bonus. The hidden risk others miss: Japanese cuisine has 300+ regional variations we must eventually master.

## Milestones

- 30 days: Sign 5 beta restaurants in San Francisco at $4,000/month
- 90 days: Achieve $50K MRR with 90% retention rate
- 6 months: Reach $200K MRR across 35 restaurants in California
- 18 months: Hit $1.5M ARR with 200+ restaurants, Series A raised
