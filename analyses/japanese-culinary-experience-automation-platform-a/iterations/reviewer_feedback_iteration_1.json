  "overall_assessment": "The analysis presents a compelling RaaS model for restaurant automation with strong unit economics and clear 10x improvement metrics. However, it misses several major competitors in the rapidly growing kitchen robotics space and makes unrealistic claims about AI training from chef footage that undermine technical credibility.",

    "Clear 7x improvement metric (450 vs 60 rolls/hour) with verified AUTEC specifications",
    "Strong unit economics with detailed CAC ($15K), LTV ($400K), and 26:1 ratio",
    "Compelling market timing with 2024-2025 data showing 52% of operators planning automation investment",

    "Checked RaaS growth benchmarks - typical path to $1M ARR is 18-24 months, not 12 months as claimed",
