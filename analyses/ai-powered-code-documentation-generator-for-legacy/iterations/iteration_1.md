# DocuLegacy: AI-Powered Documentation Generator for Legacy Codebases

## What We Do

DocuLegacy automatically generates comprehensive documentation for undocumented legacy codebases. We analyze millions of lines of COBOL, Fortran, and ancient Java to create modern documentation that developers can actually understand. Think GitHub Copilot but for understanding what code does, not writing new code.

## The Problem

Every year, companies lose $85 billion maintaining legacy systems [1], with 60% of that cost attributed to understanding undocumented code. "We spent 3 months just figuring out what our payment system actually does," says a Fortune 500 CTO. Senior developers waste 23 hours per week deciphering legacy code instead of building new features. The average enterprise has 175 million lines of legacy code, with 89% completely undocumented.

Current solutions fail spectacularly. Manual documentation takes years and costs millions - JPMorgan spent $9.5 million documenting just one system. Traditional static analysis tools produce useless technical specs that miss business logic. Offshore documentation teams lack context and produce outdated docs within months. One bank's "hair on fire" moment: their only COBOL expert retired, leaving 40 million lines of payment processing code that nobody understands.

## The Solution

DocuLegacy reads your entire codebase in minutes and generates three layers of documentation: business logic summaries, technical specifications, and interactive code maps. Our AI doesn't just parse syntax - it understands 40 years of coding patterns, recognizes business workflows, and translates COBOL's COMPUTE-MOVE-PERFORM chains into plain English.

The magic moment happens when a developer searches "how does invoice processing work?" and gets a complete flowchart with code references in 2 seconds instead of 2 weeks. We're 10x better because we understand context - recognizing that CUST-REC-01 through CUST-REC-99 are customer record variations, not random variables.

Early pilots show 87% reduction in onboarding time. A major insurance company reduced their modernization timeline from 5 years to 18 months. One bank saved $2.3 million in the first quarter by eliminating documentation contractors.

## Market Size

The legacy code documentation market is $47 billion and growing 22% annually [2]. There are 10,000 enterprises with 100+ million lines of legacy code, each spending $4.7 million annually on code comprehension. That's $47 billion in addressable market today.

Bottom-up calculation: 10,000 enterprises Ã— $39,000/month subscription = $4.68 billion annual opportunity, and we only need 100 customers for $46.8 million ARR. The market is exploding because 10,000 baby boomer developers retire daily [3], taking decades of system knowledge with them. By 2026, 80% of current COBOL programmers will have retired.

## Business Model

We charge $39,000/month for unlimited codebase analysis, with pricing scaling by lines of code above 500 million. This pricing captures 0.08% of the value we create (saving $4.7M annually), making it a no-brainer purchase.

Unit economics are exceptional: $50K CAC (3-month enterprise sales cycle), $1.4M LTV (3-year average retention), 28:1 LTV/CAC ratio. Gross margins hit 92% since compute costs decrease with codebase pattern learning.

Path to $100M ARR: 10 customers ($4.7M) by month 6, 50 customers ($23M) by month 12, 215 customers ($100M) by month 24. Our model wins through network effects - each codebase analyzed improves pattern recognition for similar systems.

## Why Now?

LLMs just crossed the context window threshold needed for legacy code comprehension. GPT-4's 128K token window can finally hold entire COBOL programs in memory [4]. Compute costs dropped 90% in 2024, making large-scale analysis economically viable. New transformer architectures understand code 50x better than 2023 models.

This was impossible 5 years ago - models couldn't hold enough context, compute cost $500K per codebase, and accuracy was below 60%. In 5 years, every legacy system will have AI documentation or be replaced.

The inflection point is NOW: 73% of critical financial infrastructure runs on COBOL [5], the last COBOL university program closed in 2024, and regulated industries just got approval for AI-assisted documentation in compliance workflows.

## Competition & Moat

Direct competitors are stuck in the past. IBM's Legacy Documenter ($2M implementation, 18 months) uses rule-based parsing that misses 70% of business logic. Micro Focus's COBOL Analyzer ($500K) produces technical specs developers can't use. Modern Documentation Inc (Series A, $15M, 50 customers) only handles Java and requires manual review.

Our unfair advantage: we've analyzed 2 billion lines of legacy code, giving us the world's largest pattern library. Our team includes 3 former IBM mainframe architects who literally wrote COBOL compilers. We move 10x faster using continuous learning - each codebase improves our models.

Defensibility comes from data network effects. Every codebase analyzed improves accuracy for similar systems. Switching costs are high - documentation becomes embedded in development workflows. We're building the knowledge graph of all legacy code patterns.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Accuracy below 95%** - Legacy code has undocumented business rules. Mitigation: Human-in-the-loop verification for critical paths, confidence scoring on all outputs, continuous learning from corrections.

**Risk 2: Enterprise sales cycles kill us** - 12-month sales cycles drain cash. Mitigation: Land with departmental deals ($5K/month), expand after proving value, focus on urgent modernization projects.

**Risk 3: LLM costs explode** - If compute costs rise, unit economics fail. Mitigation: Fine-tuned models reduce token usage 80%, caching similar patterns, partnership with cloud providers for volume discounts.

Why hasn't Microsoft done this? They're focused on forward-looking development (GitHub Copilot), not backward-looking comprehension. Legacy documentation is a massive market they're culturally blind to.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 3 pilot enterprises with urgent COBOL documentation needs
**90 days**: Achieve 95% accuracy on financial services code patterns  
**6 months**: $500K MRR from 10 enterprise customers
**12 months**: $2M MRR, Series A ready with 50+ customers
