# ChatterCore: AI-Powered Customer Support Automation

## What We Do

ChatterCore builds AI chatbots that handle 80% of customer support tickets without human intervention. We integrate with existing helpdesks (Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk) and resolve common issues in under 30 seconds, escalating complex cases to humans with full context.

## The Problem

Every growing company hits a support crisis. At 1,000 customers, founders can handle tickets personally. At 10,000, they need a team. At 100,000, support costs explode to $2-5 million annually while response times stretch to 24-48 hours.

A Series B SaaS startup CEO told us: "We're spending $300K monthly on 50 support agents, but our CSAT dropped to 72% because response times average 6 hours. Customers cancel before we can help them." The math is brutal: average support agent costs $60K/year, handles 40 tickets daily, and still makes customers wait.

Current chatbots fail because they're glorified FAQ searches. Customers type "billing problem," get five irrelevant articles, then rage-quit to find a human. Meanwhile, 67% of tickets are password resets, billing questions, and feature how-tos that shouldn't need human touch [1]. Companies are literally paying humans $30/hour to copy-paste responses.

## The Solution

ChatterCore resolves tickets in three steps: understand intent using GPT-4 fine-tuned on 10 million support conversations, execute actions through 200+ pre-built integrations (reset passwords, update billing, check order status), and generate personalized responses that match your brand voice.

The magic moment: A customer messages "I can't log in" at 2 AM. Within 12 seconds, ChatterCore identifies them, checks for account locks, sends a password reset, and confirms completion. No human touched it. The customer never waited.

Our pilot with a 5,000-employee SaaS company reduced ticket volume by 73% in 60 days. Response time dropped from 6 hours to 45 seconds. CSAT increased to 89%. They cut support costs by $180K monthly while handling 2x more volume. This isn't marginal improvement—it's eliminating an entire cost center.

## Market Size

The global customer service software market hit $11.5 billion in 2024, growing 15.1% annually [2]. But that's the old world of human-powered support. The real opportunity: 265 million knowledge workers globally spend 20% of their time on repetitive tasks.

Bottom-up: 500,000 companies with 100+ employees need support automation. At $5,000 monthly average contract value, that's a $30 billion addressable market. Just targeting the 50,000 fastest-growing SaaS companies yields $3 billion opportunity.

The inflection point: GPT-4's 2024 release made intent recognition accurate enough for production. Support automation adoption jumped from 12% to 34% among enterprises in 12 months [3].

## Business Model

We charge $2,000 base plus $0.50 per resolved ticket. A company handling 10,000 monthly tickets pays $7,000, saving $35,000 in agent costs—5x ROI month one.

Unit economics: $800 CAC through product-led growth, $168,000 LTV (24-month average retention), 95% gross margins after infrastructure costs. We're already default alive.

Path to $100M ARR: 1,000 customers by month 12 ($7M ARR), 5,000 by month 24 ($35M ARR), 15,000 by month 36 ($105M ARR). Each customer becomes a reference, driving viral growth within their industry. Our net revenue retention is 142%—customers expand usage as they see results.

## Why Now?

Three things converged in 2024: LLMs reached 95% accuracy on intent classification (versus 70% in 2022), API costs dropped 90% making unit economics work, and remote work permanent—companies can't just "hire more agents" anymore.

Five years ago, NLP couldn't handle ambiguous requests. "My subscription is broken" could mean billing, access, or feature issues. GPT-4 understands context from conversation history, user data, and behavioral patterns.

In five years, human support agents for routine tasks will seem as antiquated as switchboard operators. Gartner predicts 75% of customer interactions will be AI-handled by 2027 [4]. The question isn't if companies will adopt this, but whether they'll build or buy. We're betting they'll buy from whoever moves fastest.

GenAI adoption in customer service jumped from 6% to 24% in 2024 alone [5]. Support leaders are desperately seeking solutions—our inbound demo requests grew 400% last quarter.

## Competition & Moat

Intercom's Fin costs $0.99/resolution but requires their $99/month platform and handles only 43% of tickets successfully. Zendesk's Answer Bot resolves 29% of tickets at $0.40 each but can't execute actions—only suggest articles. Ada ($30K minimum annual contract) focuses on enterprise but takes 6 months to implement.

We resolve 76% of tickets at $0.50 each, deploy in 48 hours, and work with existing tools. Our unfair advantage: we've processed 50 million tickets across 200 companies, creating proprietary training data competitors can't replicate.

Defensibility comes from three network effects: more tickets improve our models, better models attract more customers, more customers create more integration requests which expand our moat. Plus, switching costs are high—once companies build workflows around our automations, ripping them out means rebuilding support operations.

Speed advantage: While Zendesk committees debate features, we ship daily. We'll have 1,000 customers before they launch their "next-generation" bot.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: OpenAI builds this.** They won't—customer support requires deep integrations with hundreds of tools. OpenAI builds platforms, not vertical solutions. We're their customer, not competitor.

**Risk 2: Hallucination causes PR nightmare.** We use deterministic flows for sensitive actions (refunds, account deletion) and confidence thresholds for automation. Below 95% confidence, we escalate to humans. Our error rate is 0.03%—lower than human agents.

**Risk 3: Enterprises demand on-premise deployment.** We're building private cloud options for Q3 2025. But mid-market is massive enough to build a unicorn before touching enterprise.

"Why hasn't Salesforce built this?" They're a $300 billion company focused on protecting Service Cloud revenue. Cannibalizing a $10 billion product line isn't their priority. By the time they react, we'll own the mid-market.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 10 pilot customers from waitlist
**90 days**: Achieve 70% automated resolution rate
**6 months**: $500K MRR, 75 paying customers
**12 months**: $7M ARR, Series A metrics achieved
