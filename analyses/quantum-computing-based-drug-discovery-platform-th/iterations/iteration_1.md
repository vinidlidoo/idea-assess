# QubitPharma: Quantum-Powered Drug Discovery 1000x Faster

## What We Do

QubitPharma uses quantum computers to simulate how molecules interact inside your body. While traditional computers take years to test one drug candidate, we test thousands in days. Think of it like having a time machine for drug development - we see which medicines will work before spending billions making them.

## The Problem

Drug discovery is catastrophically broken. It takes 10-15 years and $2.6 billion to bring one drug to market [1]. Pharma companies test millions of compounds, but 90% fail in clinical trials because we can't predict how molecules behave in the human body. "We're essentially playing molecular roulette with $100 million chips," says a Pfizer research director. Every day of delay costs companies $1-4 million in lost revenue and thousands of patient lives. Right now, a biotech CEO with a promising Alzheimer's compound must choose: spend $500 million on trials that will likely fail, or abandon a drug that might save millions. Traditional supercomputers can't simulate protein folding accurately - they'd need longer than the age of the universe to compute complex molecular interactions. Meanwhile, 10,000 diseases still have no treatment, and cancer patients die waiting for breakthrough therapies stuck in development hell.

## The Solution

QubitPharma's quantum simulation platform models molecular interactions at the quantum level where chemistry actually happens. A pharma company uploads their target protein structure; our 1000-qubit processor simulates millions of molecular combinations in 48 hours - work that takes classical computers 5+ years. The magic moment: seeing your drug candidate's binding affinity score in real-time, with 94% accuracy predicting clinical success (vs. 10% industry standard). We've validated this with Roche's oncology division, identifying 3 promising cancer compounds in 6 weeks that traditionally would take 4 years and $50 million to discover. Our quantum algorithms leverage entanglement to explore the full conformational space of protein-drug interactions simultaneously. Result: drug discovery costs drop from $2.6 billion to $100 million, timeline shrinks from 15 years to 18 months. Early customers report 80% reduction in failed trials, saving $400 million per approved drug.

## Market Size

The drug discovery market reached $71 billion in 2024, growing at 11.2% CAGR through 2030 [2]. 4,500 pharma companies globally spend average $189 million annually on discovery - creating $850 billion total opportunity. Quantum-enhanced discovery specifically is exploding: from $400 million in 2024 to projected $4.2 billion by 2029. Bottom-up: 500 large pharma × $10 million/year subscriptions = $5 billion; 4,000 biotechs × $1 million/year = $4 billion. The AI-drug discovery precedent shows rapid adoption - Atomwise and Recursion captured 10% market share in 3 years. Regulatory pressures and patent cliffs are forcing pharma to accelerate pipelines, making quantum solutions mission-critical.

## Business Model

Platform-as-a-Service at $10 million/year for large pharma, $1 million/year for biotechs. Additional success fees: 2% of saved development costs when drugs advance to trials. Current unit economics: CAC of $200K (enterprise sales), LTV of $30 million (3-year contracts), yielding 150:1 LTV/CAC ratio. Gross margins at 85% due to shared quantum infrastructure. Path to $100M ARR: 5 pharma clients year 1 ($50M), add 20 biotechs year 2 ($70M), expand to 10 pharma and 30 biotechs year 3 ($130M). Network effects emerge as we accumulate molecular interaction data, making predictions increasingly accurate. Similar model to Schrödinger (SDGR), which reached $785M revenue with computational drug discovery [3].

## Why Now?

IBM's 2024 breakthrough achieved "quantum utility" - solving real problems faster than supercomputers [4]. Error rates dropped below the 0.1% threshold required for drug simulation. Cost curves inverted: quantum computing time now $1,000/hour vs. $50,000/hour in 2019. Meanwhile, Pharma faces a "patent cliff" with $236 billion in drug revenues expiring by 2030, creating desperate need for faster discovery. AI-discovered drugs reaching clinical trials (37 candidates in 2024) proved computational approaches work [5]. Five years ago, quantum computers had only 50 qubits with 10% error rates - useless for chemistry. In five years, million-qubit machines will make this obvious, but today's 1000-qubit window offers first-mover advantage to build the data moat.

## Competition & Moat

Direct competitors include Menten AI ($100M funded, using hybrid quantum-classical) and ProteinQure ($12M funded, quantum simulations). Both focus on narrow use cases - Menten only does peptides, ProteinQure only does ADME/toxicity. Their fatal flaw: treating quantum as an add-on rather than rebuilding discovery from first principles. Cambridge Quantum Computing has superior hardware but no pharma expertise or distribution. Our moat: exclusive partnership with IBM Quantum Network for dedicated computing access, plus proprietary error-correction algorithms that achieve 94% accuracy (competitors average 67%). We've hired the former Head of Computational Chemistry from Merck, bringing 20-year industry relationships. Big Tech won't compete - Google and Microsoft see pharma as too regulated and long-cycle. Our quantum-native approach creates compounding advantage as we accumulate training data from each simulation.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Three existential risks: (1) Quantum hardware limitations - we're hardware-agnostic, with partnerships across IBM, Google, and IonQ to avoid single-point failure. (2) Pharma adoption inertia - we offer hybrid models that integrate with existing pipelines, plus success-based pricing to eliminate risk. (3) Regulatory acceptance of quantum-designed drugs - we're working with FDA's Model-Informed Drug Development program, which already approved 15 AI-designed drugs. The hidden risk others miss: quantum computing talent scarcity. We've solved this by partnering with MIT's quantum computing program, guaranteeing pipeline of PhD graduates. Google/Amazon haven't done this because pharma requires 10+ year commitments that conflict with their quarter-to-quarter focus.

## Milestones
