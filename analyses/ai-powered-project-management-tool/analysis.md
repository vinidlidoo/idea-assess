# Codex: AI-Powered Project Management for Engineering Teams

## What We Do

Codex is an AI project management platform that understands code. It automatically tracks engineering work by analyzing commits, pull requests, and documentation changes to generate real-time project status updates without manual input from developers.

## The Problem

Engineering teams waste 8-12 hours per week on project status updates, sprint planning, and progress tracking [1]. A senior engineer at a 50-person startup told us: "I spend more time updating JIRA than reviewing code. My manager asks for daily updates, but the tickets are always out of sync with what's actually shipped."

Current tools fail because they require constant manual updates. Engineers forget to move tickets, estimates are always wrong, and by the time the PM updates the roadmap, three new features have already shipped. The average software team has 47% of their JIRA tickets in the wrong status [2]. This creates a vicious cycle: PMs don't trust the data, so they schedule more meetings, which wastes more engineering time.

One CTO described their breaking point: "We had a board meeting where I couldn't answer basic questions about our Q3 deliverables because our project tracking was three weeks behind reality."

## The Solution

Codex connects to your GitHub/GitLab and automatically creates a living project map. When a developer pushes code, our AI analyzes the changes, updates relevant project tasks, and notifies stakeholders of progress - zero manual input required.

The magic moment happens on day one: you connect your repo, and within 60 seconds, Codex generates a complete view of all active work streams, who's working on what, and realistic completion estimates based on actual commit velocity, not wishful thinking.

We're 10x better because we track what engineers actually do (code), not what they remember to log. In pilot testing, teams reduced status meeting time by 73% and improved delivery prediction accuracy from 34% to 89% [3]. One team discovered they had two engineers unknowingly working on the same feature - Codex flagged the duplicate effort within hours.

Time saved per engineer: 8 hours/week. Management overhead reduced: 60%. Delivery prediction accuracy: 89%.

## Market Size

The project management software market is worth $7.9B in 2024, growing at 10.7% annually [4]. More specifically, 4.5 million companies worldwide employ software developers, spending an average of $20K annually on project management tools.

Bottom-up: 500,000 tech companies with 10+ developers Ã— $50K average contract = $25B addressable market. The shift to distributed teams has doubled demand for async project visibility tools since 2020 [5].

Developer productivity tools are the fastest-growing segment in B2B SaaS, with GitHub's acquisition of PullPanda and GitLab's $8B valuation validating the market appetite. Every company becoming a software company means our TAM expands beyond traditional tech into finance, healthcare, and retail.

## Business Model

We charge $49 per developer per month - priced between JIRA ($7) and LinearB ($70). This positions us as the premium option for teams that value developer time.

Unit economics: CAC of $2,000 (3-month sales cycle), LTV of $8,820 (15% monthly churn initially), giving us a 4.4x LTV/CAC ratio. Gross margins at 82% due to efficient cloud infrastructure.

Path to $100M ARR: 42,000 paying developer seats. With average team size of 25 developers, we need 1,700 enterprise customers. Year 1: 50 customers ($1.5M ARR). Year 2: 400 customers ($12M ARR). Year 3: 1,700 customers ($100M ARR).

The key metric: every hour of saved meeting time is worth $150 in developer productivity, making our ROI obvious.

## Why Now?

AI models can now understand code semantics at human level. GPT-4's code comprehension scores jumped from 67% to 94% accuracy in 2024 [6]. This wasn't possible even 18 months ago.

Five years ago, analyzing code changes required brittle regex patterns that broke constantly. Today, we can understand intent, architectural impact, and project dependencies from raw diffs. The cost to process 1M lines of code dropped from $500 to $3 in the last year alone [7].

The shift is happening now: Microsoft's GitHub Copilot has 1.8M paid subscribers after just 18 months [8]. Enterprises are desperately seeking AI tools that enhance rather than replace developers. Our early customers are pulling us into deals because they've already budgeted for "AI-powered developer tools" in 2025.

## Competition & Moat

Linear raised $35M and has 5,000+ customers but requires manual updates. Asana ($11B market cap) focuses on non-technical teams. LinearB ($900K ARR) provides metrics but no project management. All miss the core insight: engineers won't update tools, so the tool must update itself.

Our unfair advantage: we're the only team that combines deep project management expertise (our CEO led PM at Stripe) with code analysis infrastructure (our CTO built Google's code review analytics). We have proprietary models trained on 2M+ real project histories that understand the difference between a bug fix and a feature launch.

Defensibility comes from our data network effect: every project we track improves our estimation models. After analyzing 10,000 projects, we can predict completion dates 3x more accurately than any competitor. Switching costs are high because teams build workflows around our automated insights.

We'll win by moving fast: shipping daily while competitors debate features in committee.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: GitHub/GitLab builds this.** They're focused on individual developer productivity, not team coordination. We're building the layer above version control - if they acquire anyone, it would be us.

**Risk 2: Enterprises won't trust AI with project data.** We offer on-premise deployment and SOC2 compliance from day one. Our AI never trains on customer code.

**Risk 3: Developers revolt against "surveillance."** We explicitly don't measure individual productivity. Codex tracks project progress, not people. Our early users actually love it because it eliminates micromanagement.

Why BigCo hasn't done this: They're stuck supporting legacy manual workflows. Atlassian can't cannibalize JIRA's $3B revenue. We can build the future without protecting the past.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 10 beta customers using Codex daily, 70+ NPS score
**90 days**: $25K MRR from paying pilots
**6 months**: $250K MRR, Series A metrics achieved
**12 months**: $2M ARR, 100+ enterprise customers
