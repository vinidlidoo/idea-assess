# FitWise AI: AI-Powered Fitness Coaching for Active Aging

## What We Do

FitWise AI is a personalized fitness app for adults 65+ that uses computer vision to provide real-time exercise guidance and fall prevention training. Think "Peloton meets physical therapy" - your phone watches you exercise and corrects your form instantly, preventing injuries common in seniors.

## The Problem

Every year, 3 million older adults visit emergency rooms for fall injuries, costing $50 billion annually in medical expenses [1]. Traditional fitness solutions fail seniors spectacularly. Generic workout apps assume mobility that doesn't exist - "do 20 burpees" means nothing to someone with arthritis. In-person trainers cost $60-100/hour and require transportation many seniors lack. Group classes move too fast and can't accommodate individual limitations.

"I stopped exercising after hip surgery because I was terrified of falling again," says Margaret, 72, from Phoenix. "YouTube videos don't tell me if I'm doing it wrong. I spent $3,000 on physical therapy just to learn basic movements safely." The CDC reports that 1 in 4 Americans 65+ fall each year, yet only 38% do strength training that could prevent these falls. Seniors desperately need guided, safe, adaptive exercise they can do at home.

## The Solution

FitWise AI uses your phone's camera to watch you exercise and provide instant corrections. Open the app, prop your phone against a wall, and start. The AI recognizes your movements, spots dangerous form, and adjusts difficulty in real-time. If you're leaning too far forward during a squat, it tells you immediately. Can't do a full squat? It automatically suggests a chair-assisted version.

Our pilot with 50 seniors showed 73% reduction in exercise-related injuries and 4x improvement in consistency compared to YouTube videos. Users exercise 4.2 days/week versus 1.1 days with traditional apps. The magic moment happens in session one: the app stops them mid-exercise, corrects their form, and they realize "this thing actually sees me." One user avoided a fall by fixing her balance stance in week two. Time to confidence: 5 minutes. Cost savings versus physical therapy: $2,400/year.

## Market Size

The global digital fitness market for seniors will reach $14.8 billion by 2026, growing at 28% CAGR [2]. In the US alone, 54 million adults are 65+, projected to hit 95 million by 2060. With 71% of seniors owning smartphones and 61% seeking digital health tools, our addressable market is 33 million users in the US.

Bottom-up: 33 million smartphone-enabled seniors × $20/month subscription × 12 months = $7.9 billion US opportunity. Medicare Advantage plans cover 28 million seniors and increasingly reimburse preventive fitness programs. Landing just 5 major MA contracts (500K members each) at $15/member/month yields $450M ARR.

## Business Model

We charge $19.99/month direct-to-consumer or $15/month through Medicare Advantage partnerships. Our unit economics: CAC of $45 through targeted Facebook ads to senior communities, LTV of $480 (24-month average retention), yielding 10.7x LTV/CAC ratio. Gross margins are 87% since we're software-only.

Path to $100M ARR: Year 1: 10K users ($2.4M), Year 2: 50K users + 2 MA pilots ($14M), Year 3: 150K users + 5 MA contracts ($54M), Year 4: 300K users + 10 MA contracts ($108M). The killer metric: every 1% reduction in fall rates saves MA plans $2,100 per member annually, making our $180/year cost a 11.7x ROI.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this inevitable now. First, smartphone adoption among 65+ jumped from 18% in 2013 to 71% in 2024 [3]. Second, iOS and Android now include native pose detection APIs (released 2023) that work on 5-year-old phones - no special hardware needed. Third, Medicare started covering digital fitness programs in 2024 under new CMS guidelines for preventive care.

Five years ago, seniors didn't have smartphones and pose detection required $1,000+ Kinect sensors. Five years from now, every Medicare plan will require digital fall prevention programs. The pandemic created 50 million new senior digital health users who now expect virtual care. 2024 saw the first FDA clearance for AI-based fall risk assessment software [4], legitimizing the entire category.

## Competition & Moat

SilverSneakers (5M users, $300M revenue) offers gym access but no personalization - it's group classes that many seniors can't follow. Bold (10K users, $15M raised) provides human trainers via video but costs $120/month and can't scale. Lark Health ($100M raised) focuses on chronic disease, not fitness. None use computer vision for real-time form correction.

Our unfair advantage: 2 years of proprietary training data from 50,000+ senior exercise sessions, teaching our AI to recognize compensation patterns specific to aging bodies. A 25-year-old's squat looks nothing like a 75-year-old's safe squat. Competitors using generic pose detection fail immediately. Our switching costs are high: users build 6-month personalized progression plans. After 3 months, the AI knows your specific limitations better than any human trainer. We'll win through speed - launching with 5 major Medicare Advantage plans while competitors still pitch their first.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Top 3 risks: (1) Liability for exercise injuries - mitigated through comprehensive waivers, insurance, and FDA registration as a Class II wellness device. (2) Medicare reimbursement changes - building direct-to-consumer base as hedge, already 60% of revenue. (3) Apple/Google entering the space - they lack healthcare distribution and senior-specific training data.

Why hasn't Peloton done this? They chase high-spending 30-somethings, not Medicare reimbursements. Their brand screams intensity; ours whispers safety. We'll win because healthcare distribution requires 18-month sales cycles and compliance expertise Peloton won't build for a "small" market.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 500 beta users, 80% week-2 retention
**90 days**: FDA Class II submission, 2,000 paying users
**6 months**: First Medicare Advantage pilot (10K covered lives)
**12 months**: $2M ARR, 3 MA contracts signed
