# FitWise AI: AI-Powered Fitness Companion for Active Aging

## What We Do

FitWise AI is an adaptive fitness app that uses computer vision and AI to guide seniors through safe, personalized exercises at home. The app watches your form through your phone camera, adjusts difficulty in real-time, and provides modifications for mobility limitations - like having a physical therapist in your pocket 24/7.

## The Problem

Every year, 3 million seniors visit emergency rooms due to fall-related injuries, costing Medicare $50 billion annually [1]. Traditional fitness solutions fail this population catastrophically. Gym memberships assume mobility and transportation that 28% of seniors lack. Generic fitness apps ignore arthritis, balance issues, or hip replacements that affect 54% of adults over 65. Personal trainers specialized in senior fitness charge $75-150/hour and are geographically limited.

"I stopped exercising after my knee replacement because I was terrified of doing something wrong," says Margaret, 72, from Phoenix. "YouTube videos move too fast and never show modifications. My doctor says exercise is critical, but I can't afford $300/week for a trainer." This is the reality for 47 million seniors who need guided exercise but can't access appropriate instruction. The result: muscle atrophy, increased fall risk, and $213 billion in preventable healthcare costs from sedentary-related conditions.

## The Solution

FitWise AI creates a magic moment in the first session: the camera identifies your physical limitations, suggests a seated yoga routine, then guides you through each movement with real-time feedback. "Raise your arm a bit higher... perfect! Hold for 3 more seconds." It's like FaceTime with a patient, knowledgeable trainer who never judges and always adapts.

The 10x improvement comes from AI-powered personalization at scale. Computer vision tracks 33 body points to ensure safe form, preventing the injuries that sideline 41% of seniors who exercise unsupervised. Machine learning adapts difficulty based on your performance - if you struggle with 10 reps, tomorrow it suggests 8. Early pilots with 200 seniors show 73% still actively using the app after 90 days (versus 8% for generic fitness apps), with average strength improvements of 31% and fall incidents reduced by 52%.

The system works through progressive adaptation: start with assessment, establish baseline capabilities, then incrementally increase challenge while monitoring fatigue and form degradation. Every session generates data that refines your personal model, creating an increasingly effective program that evolves with your changing abilities.

## Market Size

The global senior fitness market reaches $17.2 billion in 2024, growing at 8.2% annually as the 65+ population doubles to 1.6 billion by 2040 [2]. In the US alone, 54 million seniors represent a $4.3 billion opportunity at $80/year subscription pricing.

Bottom-up calculation: 10,000 early adopters Ã— $20/month = $2.4M ARR year one. Scale to 100,000 users (0.2% of US seniors) = $24M ARR by year three. International expansion to English-speaking markets adds 300,000 potential users. Medicare Advantage partnerships, covering 28 million beneficiaries, represent a $2.2 billion B2B2C opportunity. The convergence of aging demographics, smartphone adoption among seniors (61% and rising), and healthcare cost pressures makes this market inevitable.

## Business Model

Direct-to-consumer subscription at $19.99/month, positioning below personal training ($300+/month) but above generic fitness apps ($10/month). Premium tier at $39.99/month includes live group classes and monthly PT consultations.

Unit economics: CAC of $45 through targeted Facebook/NextDoor campaigns to senior communities. LTV of $480 (24-month average retention) yields 10.7x CAC ratio. Gross margins reach 82% after cloud infrastructure costs. At 100,000 subscribers, we hit $24M ARR with 67% EBITDA margins.

The path to $100M ARR: 420,000 subscribers by year five through B2C (200,000 users), Medicare Advantage partnerships (150,000), and international expansion (70,000). The killer metric: every 1% reduction in fall-related hospitalizations saves insurers $500 million, making our $240 annual price a 2000x ROI.

## Why Now?

Smartphone adoption among 65+ adults hit 61% in 2024, up from 18% in 2019 - the infrastructure finally exists [3]. Computer vision APIs from Google and Apple now run efficiently on-device, eliminating privacy concerns and latency that killed earlier attempts. COVID-19 permanently shifted senior comfort with digital health tools - telehealth usage among Medicare beneficiaries jumped from 1% to 43% and stabilized at 22%.

Five years ago, the technology couldn't deliver reliable pose detection on consumer devices. Today, MediaPipe processes 30fps video with 96% accuracy on a 2019 iPhone. Five years from now, every insurance plan will cover digital fitness interventions as standard care. The window is now: seniors are digitally ready but solutions haven't caught up. CMS just approved reimbursement codes for digital therapeutics, creating a covered benefit that didn't exist in 2023.

## Competition & Moat

SilverSneakers dominates with 16 million members but requires gym attendance - impossible for our core market of mobility-limited seniors. Mirror/Peloton ignored seniors entirely before their implosions. Bold ($12/month) offers senior-friendly classes but lacks personalization and form correction, treating all users identically.

Our unfair advantage: 18 months of movement data from 200 beta users, creating the only AI model trained specifically on senior biomechanics. While competitors retrofit general fitness apps, we're building the proprietary dataset that improves with every user. Network effects emerge through group classes and community features - seniors exercise 3x more consistently with peer accountability.

Defensibility comes from three layers: (1) Switching costs - users invest months training their personal AI model, (2) Clinical validation - our 12-month RCT with Stanford creates regulatory moat, (3) Distribution advantages through Medicare partnerships competitors can't access without outcomes data. Speed matters: every month of user data widens our training advantage. Competitors face the classic chicken-egg problem: they need senior users to train models, but need trained models to attract senior users.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Technology adoption resistance**: Seniors struggle with new apps. Mitigation: Onboarding specialists conduct video setup calls, achieving 94% successful first sessions. Family member co-accounts let children help parents.

**Liability for exercise injuries**: Someone will get hurt. Mitigation: Liability insurance, mandatory health clearances, conservative exercise parameters, and explicit form warnings reduce risk. Our beta had zero reported injuries across 18,000 sessions.

**Apple/Google platform risk**: They could build this. Mitigation: Focus on clinical validation and insurance partnerships creates defensibility beyond technology. Apple targets general wellness; we're building a medical device-grade solution.

Why hasn't Amazon/Apple done this? They chase billion-user markets. Seniors require specialized UX, longer sales cycles, and healthcare integrations that don't fit their business models. We win by focusing exclusively on this underserved segment.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 500 beta users onboarded, 70% week-2 retention achieved
**90 days**: $50K MRR, Stanford RCT enrollment complete
**6 months**: 5,000 paying subscribers, $100K MRR
**12 months**: First Medicare Advantage contract signed, $500K MRR
