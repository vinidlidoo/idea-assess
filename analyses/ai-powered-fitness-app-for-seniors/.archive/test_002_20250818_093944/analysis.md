# SilverFit AI: AI-Powered Fitness for Seniors with Mobility Limitations

## What We Do

SilverFit AI is a fitness app that uses computer vision to guide seniors through safe exercises at home. The AI watches their form through their phone camera and adjusts exercises in real-time based on their mobility limitations. Think "Peloton meets physical therapy" for the 54 million seniors who can't do traditional workouts.

## The Problem

Every day, 10,000 Americans turn 65. Margaret, 72, from Ohio told us: "I spent $3,000 on physical therapy last year just to maintain basic mobility. I can't get to the gym anymore, and YouTube videos move too fast."

Seniors lose 3-8% of muscle mass per decade after 30, accelerating after 60. This leads to 36 million falls annually, costing $50 billion in medical expenses [1]. Current solutions fail because gym classes assume full mobility, physical therapy costs $100-150 per session, and generic fitness apps ignore balance issues, joint problems, and medication side effects that affect 90% of seniors.

The breaking point: John, 68, fell doing a YouTube workout designed for younger people. His hip replacement surgery cost $40,000. He needed something that understood his artificial knee couldn't bend past 90 degrees. That's when his daughter called us desperately seeking a solution.

## The Solution

Users prop their phone against a wall and our AI coach, "Sophie," greets them by name. The camera tracks 33 body points, instantly detecting if they're using a walker, seated, or standing. Sophie demonstrates a modified squat: "Let's do chair stands today, John. I see you're favoring your left knee."

This is 10x better because we adapt in real-time. When the AI detects unstable balance, it immediately suggests holding a chair. When range of motion decreases, it adjusts the exercise difficulty. No more dangerous guessing.

Our pilot with 200 seniors at Sunrise Senior Living showed 73% sustained daily use after 90 days (vs. 4% for regular fitness apps), 60% reduction in fall risk scores, and users saved $2,400/year avoiding physical therapy visits. The AI uses pose estimation models fine-tuned on 50,000 hours of senior movement data to understand limitations that younger-focused apps miss entirely.

## Market Size

The global senior fitness market reaches $15.7 billion in 2024, growing at 8.2% CAGR [2]. In the US alone, 54 million adults over 65 spend $4.5 trillion annually on healthcare.

Bottom-up: 54M US seniors × 30% smartphone adoption × $30/month subscription = $5.8B addressable market. Add Medicare Advantage partnerships (covering 28M seniors), and the opportunity doubles. The market explodes as baby boomers age - by 2030, all boomers will be 65+, expanding our TAM to 73 million.

This isn't about capturing market share from gyms. We're creating an entirely new category: medical-grade fitness that insurance will pay for, just like they now cover Omada Health for diabetes (valued at $1B+).

## Business Model

Direct-to-consumer at $29.99/month, with Medicare Advantage reimbursement at $89/month (following Omada's playbook). Initial CAC of $65 through senior center partnerships, with 18-month average retention yielding $540 LTV.

Gross margins hit 82% at scale - our only costs are cloud compute ($2/user/month) and content creation. Unlike physical therapy ($150/visit), we scale infinitely. Unit economics: Contribution margin positive at month 3, 8.3x LTV/CAC ratio.

Path to $100M ARR: 10,000 users year 1 ($3.6M), 50,000 year 2 via Medicare partnerships ($18M), 280,000 users year 3 ($100M). Comparable: Sword Health hit $100M ARR in 3 years with digital physical therapy - we're attacking a market 5x larger.

## Why Now?

Smartphone adoption among 65+ Americans jumped from 18% in 2013 to 61% in 2024 [3]. COVID normalized video-based health interactions - telehealth usage among seniors increased 38x and stuck at 17x pre-pandemic levels.

Five years ago, impossible: Seniors didn't have smartphones, pose estimation required $5,000 sensors, and Medicare didn't reimburse digital health. Today, iPhone's LiDAR and on-device ML makes medical-grade motion tracking free.

In five years, this will be obvious. CMS added reimbursement codes for "digital therapeutic exercise" in January 2024. The holy shit moment: Medicare Advantage plans now MUST reduce fall rates or face penalties up to $500 per member starting 2025 [4] - they're desperate for our solution.

## Competition & Moat

SilverStrong raised $12M but focuses on group classes, missing homebound seniors. Bold has 10,000 users but requires expensive hardware ($299 upfront). Mirror/Peloton ignore seniors entirely. Traditional apps like MyFitnessPal can't see users, making them dangerous for those with mobility limits.

Our unfair advantage: 50,000 hours of senior-specific movement data that took 3 years to collect. Every competitor starts from zero. Our clinical advisory board includes the former head of Johns Hopkins Geriatrics, opening doors competitors can't access.

Network effects kick in through our "family sharing" feature - adult children monitor parents' progress, driving viral loops. Switching costs are high once Medicare covers it (changing requires doctor approval). Our AI improves with each user, widening the moat daily.

Speed wins: We'll have 10,000 users before competitors realize the opportunity. Their fitness focus blinds them to the medical reimbursement path that makes this venture-scale.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Regulatory risk**: FDA could classify us as medical device. Mitigation: Following Omada's path as "wellness" product with clinical validation but no treatment claims. Already engaged regulatory counsel who cleared Livongo.

**Technology adoption**: Seniors struggle with tech. Mitigation: One-button setup, family member onboarding program, and partnering with senior centers for in-person training. Our NPS of 72 proves seniors love it once they try it.

**Competition from Apple/Google**: They'll eventually enter. Mitigation: Our medical-grade focus and Medicare relationships create a defensible niche they won't pursue (too complex for consumer teams).

Why hasn't Peloton done this? They're focused on high-spending millennials. Senior fitness has different physics: slower growth, longer retention, insurance complexity. We're built for this from day one.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Launch pilot with 3 senior living facilities (500 residents)
**90 days**: Achieve 70% week-2 retention rate
**6 months**: $50K MRR, Medicare Advantage LOI signed
**12 months**: $300K MRR, 10,000 MAU, Series A ready
