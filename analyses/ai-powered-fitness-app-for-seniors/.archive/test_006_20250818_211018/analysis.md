# SilverFit AI: Adaptive Movement Coaching for Seniors with Limited Mobility

## What We Do

SilverFit AI is an AI-powered fitness app that creates personalized, safe exercise routines for seniors with mobility limitations. Think "Peloton meets physical therapy" - we use computer vision to monitor form, adapt exercises in real-time, and prevent falls while helping seniors maintain independence longer.

## The Problem

Every year, 1 in 4 Americans over 65 falls, costing $50 billion in medical expenses [1]. More critically, 28% of seniors report doing no physical activity beyond basic daily tasks, accelerating muscle loss by 3-8% per decade after age 30. Current solutions fail because generic fitness apps ignore mobility limitations - telling an 82-year-old with arthritis to do burpees is dangerous and discouraging.

"I stopped going to the senior center gym after I fell trying to keep up with the class. Now I just sit at home getting weaker," reports Martha, 79, from Phoenix. Physical therapy costs $150-350 per session, with Medicare covering only 20 visits annually. YouTube videos can't see if you're doing exercises wrong or about to lose balance. The result: 47% of seniors lose the ability to walk independently within a year of their first fall.

## The Solution

SilverFit AI uses your phone's camera to create a "digital physical therapist" in your living room. During setup, we assess balance, range of motion, and strength through simple movements. Our AI then generates personalized 15-minute daily routines, monitoring form through computer vision and adjusting difficulty in real-time.

The magic moment: When Dorothy, 81, with severe knee arthritis, completed her first week without pain - our AI had detected her compensation patterns and modified her squats to seated leg lifts, increasing strength while protecting her joints. In our 500-person pilot, users showed 40% improvement in balance scores, 62% reduction in fall risk indicators, and averaged 5.2 sessions per week (vs. 1.8 for generic fitness apps). The system works by combining OpenPose skeletal tracking with a medical movement database of 1,200+ exercises categorized by joint impact, balance requirements, and cardiovascular intensity.

## Market Size

The global senior fitness market reaches $17.2 billion in 2024, growing at 8.2% CAGR through 2030 [2]. Bottom-up: 54 million US seniors × 28% need movement help × $30/month subscription = $5.4 billion addressable market in the US alone.

The market is exploding due to the "silver tsunami" - 10,000 Americans turn 65 daily, and by 2030, all baby boomers will be 65+. Digital health adoption among seniors jumped from 12% to 61% during COVID-19, permanently shifting behavior. Medicare Advantage plans now cover digital fitness benefits, creating a B2B2C opportunity worth $2.8 billion by 2026.

## Business Model

We charge $29.99/month direct-to-consumer, or $14.99/month through Medicare Advantage partnerships. With a CAC of $85 through targeted Facebook ads (seniors are 3x more engaged than younger demographics) and 18-month average retention, our LTV/CAC ratio is 6.3x.

Path to $100M ARR: 10,000 users by month 6 ($3.6M ARR), 50,000 by month 12 ($18M ARR), 280,000 by month 24 ($100M ARR) - requiring just 0.5% market penetration. The killer metric: our negative net churn of -5% monthly as users add family members. Medicare Advantage partnerships accelerate this - one mid-size plan with 100,000 members converts at 15%, adding 15,000 users instantly.

## Why Now?

Five years ago, this was impossible: pose estimation required $10,000+ depth cameras and cloud compute cost $500/user/month. Today, MediaPipe runs skeletal tracking on-device at 30fps on a 2019 iPhone. Edge AI chips reduced inference costs 1000x since 2019.

The behavioral shift is dramatic: senior smartphone adoption hit 86% in 2024 (vs. 42% in 2019) [3]. Medicare's 2024 rule change now reimburses "digital therapeutics" at the same rate as in-person therapy. Most critically, the pandemic normalized video-based healthcare for seniors - telehealth usage among Medicare beneficiaries increased 38x and stuck at 15x pre-pandemic levels. The convergence of technical capability, behavioral acceptance, and reimbursement creates a perfect storm.

## Competition & Moat

**Bold** (10,000 users, $7M raised) offers live video classes but requires seniors to follow along at fixed times - 68% drop-off rate after 30 days. **SilverSneakers** (15M eligible members through insurance) provides gym access but only 8% actively participate - seniors won't drive to gyms. **Mirror/Peloton** ($1,500+ hardware) targets younger demographics with high-intensity workouts inappropriate for seniors.

Our unfair advantage: proprietary dataset of 50,000 hours of senior movement patterns, labeling every compensation, instability, and fatigue signal. This data moat grows with every user. Our clinical advisory board includes the former head of Johns Hopkins Geriatrics, giving us credibility competitors lack. We win through speed - while Bold schedules classes, we're shipping daily AI improvements. Network effects emerge as users share progress with family, who then subscribe to monitor parents remotely.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: FDA regulation** - Digital therapeutics face increasing scrutiny. Mitigation: We position as "wellness" not "medical device," avoiding FDA oversight while partnering with cleared devices for medical claims.

**Risk 2: Tech adoption barriers** - Some seniors struggle with smartphones. Mitigation: Family member onboarding (adult children set up for parents) drives 45% of signups. Voice-first UI reduces complexity.

**Risk 3: Liability concerns** - Injuries during exercise could generate lawsuits. Mitigation: Comprehensive waivers, $5M liability insurance, and conservative exercise progressions (we'd rather under-challenge than risk injury).

Why hasn't Apple done this? They're focused on younger demographics (Apple Fitness+ average user age: 34). Healthcare requires regulatory expertise and clinical partnerships Apple avoids. Most importantly, this market requires patient capital - it's not a $1B+ opportunity until year 5.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 100 beta users with 70% week-2 retention
**90 days**: 1,000 paying subscribers, LOI from first Medicare Advantage plan
**6 months**: $300K MRR, clinical study showing fall reduction published
**12 months**: $1.5M MRR, FDA clearance submitted, Series A raised at $50M+ valuation
