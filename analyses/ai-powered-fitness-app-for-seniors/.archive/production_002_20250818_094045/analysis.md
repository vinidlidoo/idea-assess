# SilverFit AI: AI-Powered Fitness Companion for Seniors with Mobility Limitations

## What We Do

SilverFit AI is a voice-activated fitness app that creates personalized exercise routines for adults over 65 with arthritis, joint pain, or mobility restrictions. Like having a physical therapist in your pocket, it watches you move through your phone camera and adjusts exercises in real-time to match what your body can do today.

## The Problem

"I stopped exercising because I'm terrified of falling again," says Margaret, 72, who broke her hip last year. She's one of 54 million seniors with arthritis who've given up on fitness [1]. Traditional fitness apps show young athletes doing burpees while seniors struggle to stand from a chair. Physical therapy costs $150 per session, and Medicare covers only 20 visits annually. Group fitness classes move too fast, assume everyone can do the same movements, and don't account for bad pain days.

The result? 28% of adults over 65 are completely inactive, leading to 250,000 hip fractures yearly costing $40,000 each [2]. Seniors waste hours searching YouTube for "gentle exercises" only to find instructors saying "just modify if you need to" without showing how. One user reported trying six different apps before giving up: "They all assume I can get on the floor. I haven't been on the floor in five years."

## The Solution

Users simply tell SilverFit AI "My knees hurt today" and receive a modified 15-minute routine instantly. The app's computer vision tracks movement through the phone camera, detecting compensation patterns and adjusting difficulty in real-time. When it sees you struggling with arm raises, it automatically reduces range of motion. When you're doing well, it gradually increases challenge.

Early pilots with 200 seniors showed 73% sustained daily use after 90 days versus 12% for standard fitness apps [3]. Users completed 4.2 sessions weekly, reduced pain scores by 35%, and improved sit-to-stand time by 22% in eight weeks. The magic moment happens day three when the AI says "I noticed your shoulder mobility improved - let's try reaching a bit higher today" and users realize it actually sees them.

Cost reduction is dramatic: $9.99 monthly versus $600 for four PT sessions. Time to value: immediate personalized routine versus two-week wait for PT appointment.

## Market Size

The U.S. mobility-limited senior fitness market represents $4.8 billion opportunity in 2024 [4]. With 73 million adults over 65 by 2030 and 67% experiencing mobility limitations, our addressable market is 49 million people. At $120 annual subscription, every 1% penetration equals $58.8 million revenue.

The senior fitness app market grew 47% yearly from 2020-2024, accelerated by COVID-19 isolation [5]. Physical therapy shortages mean 6.2 million seniors can't access care. Medicare Advantage plans increasingly cover digital fitness benefits, with 62% offering app subscriptions in 2024 versus 18% in 2022.

## Business Model

B2C subscription at $9.99 monthly targets individual seniors. B2B2C partnerships with Medicare Advantage plans at $4 per member per month reaches millions instantly. Enterprise pricing for senior living facilities at $500 monthly per location covers unlimited residents.

CAC through Facebook targeted ads: $32. LTV at 18-month average retention: $180. Gross margin: 87% after cloud compute costs. Path to $100M: 70,000 B2C subscribers plus contracts with two major Medicare Advantage plans covering 350,000 members each. Comparable exit: MyFitnessPal sold for $475M at 80 million users; we need only 850,000 paying users for similar multiple.

## Why Now?

Smartphone adoption among 65+ adults reached 86% in 2024 versus 42% in 2019 [6]. Edge AI processing enables real-time movement analysis on standard phones - impossible until Apple's Neural Engine and Google's Tensor chips in 2023. Medicare regulatory changes in 2024 specifically authorize reimbursement for "AI-assisted therapeutic movement programs."

The pandemic trained seniors on video interaction - Zoom usage among 70+ increased 850% and stuck [7]. Cost curves make this viable: computer vision APIs that cost $50/month in 2019 now cost $0.80. Meanwhile, physical therapist shortages worsen - 26% unfilled positions with average $92,000 salaries driving unsustainable clinic economics.

## Competition & Moat

SilverSteps (2M users, $8M revenue) offers video workouts but no personalization - it's just YouTube in an app. Bold ($15M raised) targets Parkinson's specifically, missing broader market. Retrofit focuses on weight loss, ignoring mobility limitations. None use computer vision for real-time form correction.

Our unfair advantage: proprietary dataset of 2 million senior movement videos annotated by licensed PTs, impossible to replicate without 18 months and $3M. Our clinical advisory board includes Mayo Clinic's geriatric rehab director, opening institutional sales channels competitors can't access. Network effects compound as each user's movement patterns improve AI recommendations for similar body types and conditions.

Switching costs are high once users train the AI on their specific limitations. Speed advantage: shipping weekly updates while competitors' regulatory-focused approach means 6-month release cycles. Biggest competitor limitation: they're building for PTs who prescribe to seniors; we're building for seniors directly.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**FDA regulation**: Currently operating under wellness exemption; preparing 510(k) submission for therapeutic claims with regulatory consultant who cleared similar apps. **Liability concerns**: $5M insurance policy, clear disclaimers, and PT review of all exercise libraries. **User tech literacy**: Voice-first interface eliminates typing; adult children can set up remotely in five minutes.

Why hasn't Peloton done this? Their $2,000 LTV customer won't pay $2,000 for grandma. Their brand is aspirational fitness; seniors want safety. Their instructors are chosen for energy and aesthetics; seniors need credentials and empathy. Plus they're losing $300M quarterly - no resources for new markets.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 500 beta users from senior center partnerships
**90 days**: 2,000 paying subscribers, 4.5 app store rating
**6 months**: $50K MRR, letter of intent from one Medicare plan
**12 months**: $200K MRR, 15,000 users, Series A metrics achieved
