# FitWise: AI-powered fitness app for seniors with mobility limitations

## What We Do

FitWise is an AI fitness coach specifically designed for adults over 65 with arthritis, joint pain, or mobility restrictions. The app uses computer vision to watch seniors exercise at home, providing real-time form corrections and automatically adapting workouts based on their physical limitations and daily pain levels.

## The Problem

"I'm 72 and every fitness app shows me doing burpees. I can barely get out of my chair some days," reports Margaret Chen, one of 54 million seniors struggling with arthritis [1]. The average senior spends $2,800 annually on physical therapy that requires transportation, scheduling, and often causes more pain than relief. Current fitness apps are built for 25-year-olds—they show impossible exercises, ignore chronic conditions, and provide zero guidance on safe movement modifications.

Today, 73% of seniors want to exercise but quit within 3 weeks because they injure themselves or feel overwhelmed [2]. Medicare covers only 20 PT visits annually, leaving seniors with 345 days of no professional guidance. One user described attempting YouTube yoga: "I fell trying to do warrior pose and spent 6 weeks recovering. Now I'm scared to try anything." This fear of injury keeps 31 million seniors completely sedentary, accelerating their decline into disability.

## The Solution

When users open FitWise, the AI immediately assesses their range of motion through their phone camera—no special equipment needed. "Show me how you reach overhead," the app requests, then builds a custom program around their exact limitations. During exercises, the computer vision system watches for dangerous compensations: "Keep your knee behind your toes" appears instantly when form breaks down.

The magic happens in real-time adaptation. User reports knee pain at level 7/10? The AI immediately switches from standing exercises to seated alternatives. Heart rate spikes above personalized threshold? Automatic rest period initiated. Users see 67% reduction in exercise-related injuries and 3.2x improvement in consistency compared to generic programs [3]. The system learns from 50,000+ senior exercise sessions monthly, continuously improving its safety protocols and modification database.

Early pilots with 500 seniors show 89% still actively using the app after 6 months, compared to 12% retention for standard fitness apps.

## Market Size

The global senior fitness market reaches $17.2 billion in 2024, growing at 21% annually as the 65+ population expands by 3 million yearly [4]. In the US alone, 54 million seniors represent a $4.8 billion opportunity at $89/year subscription pricing.

Bottom-up calculation: 54M seniors × 40% with mobility issues × 25% smartphone adoption × 10% conversion × $89/year = $480M immediate addressable market. Medicare Advantage plans covering 29 million seniors actively seek digital health solutions that reduce PT costs—they'll pay $15/member/month for proven solutions. International expansion doubles TAM to $960M by 2027.

## Business Model

Direct-to-consumer subscription at $7.99/month undercuts personal training ($600/month) and most PT copays ($40/visit). Medicare Advantage partnerships at $15/member/month for bulk subscriptions. CAC through senior centers and doctor referrals: $32. LTV with 18-month average retention: $144. Gross margins at 82% due to AI-driven service delivery.

Path to $100M ARR: 10,000 paid users month 6 ($960K ARR), 50,000 users year 1 ($4.8M), 250,000 users year 2 ($24M) through Medicare Advantage partnerships covering 50,000 members each. Year 3 targets 1M users ($96M) as we become covered benefit for major insurers. Each Medicare contract adds 50,000 potential users instantly, making scaling exponential rather than linear.

## Why Now?

Computer vision accuracy for pose detection improved from 72% to 94% between 2020-2024, finally reaching medical-grade reliability [5]. Smartphone adoption among 65+ seniors jumped from 42% to 78% during COVID. New CMS rules starting January 2024 allow Medicare Advantage plans to cover digital fitness programs as preventive care—a $2.1 billion reimbursement category that didn't exist before.

The cost of falls among seniors hit $52 billion in 2024, forcing insurers to desperately seek prevention solutions [6]. Meanwhile, the physical therapy shortage means average wait times reached 3 weeks in major cities. The pandemic permanently normalized video-based health services for seniors—telehealth usage among 65+ remains 38x higher than pre-2020 levels.

## Competition & Moat

SilverSneakers (8M users, $400M revenue) offers only generic group classes with zero personalization. Bold (50K users, $12M raised) focuses on balance training but lacks real-time form correction. Retrofit (30K users) requires expensive wearables seniors won't buy. None use computer vision for safety monitoring—the key feature preventing injuries.

Our unfair advantage: 2-year exclusive partnership with Mayo Clinic's Healthy Aging Program, providing medical validation and distribution to 1.3M patients. Our founding physical therapist spent 10 years treating seniors exclusively, encoding 10,000+ movement modifications into our AI. Patent pending on our "adaptive difficulty algorithm" that adjusts mid-exercise based on movement quality decay. First-mover advantage in Medicare Advantage coverage creates 18-month head start on reimbursement relationships.

Competitors focus on young-old (65-75) who don't need us. We exclusively target old-old (75+) with multiple conditions—a segment others avoid due to liability fears.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Liability from injuries**: Comprehensive insurance plus disclaimer requiring doctor clearance. Partner with senior centers for supervised initial sessions. AI conservative by design—better to under-challenge than risk injury.

**Tech adoption by 85+ segment**: Children often set up and manage subscriptions. Voice-first interface eliminates typing. Partner with Area Agencies on Aging for digital literacy training.

**Why hasn't Peloton done this?** Peloton's unit economics require $40/month pricing and younger demographics for marketing efficiency. Seniors won't pay premium prices and cost 3x more to acquire through traditional channels. Our Medicare Advantage model bypasses consumer acquisition entirely.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 100 beta users from 3 senior centers providing form correction validation data
**90 days**: Medicare Advantage LOI from regional plan covering 100,000 seniors
**6 months**: $500K MRR from 5,000 direct subscribers plus first insurance contract
**12 months**: $2.5M ARR, 25,000 total users, FDA clearance as Class II medical device software
