# SilverFit AI: AI-Powered Adaptive Fitness for Seniors with Mobility Limitations

## What We Do

SilverFit AI is a mobile fitness coach that adapts exercises in real-time for seniors with arthritis, joint replacements, or mobility issues. Think Peloton meets physical therapy - but it actually watches you move and adjusts when you're struggling.

## The Problem

Every day, 10,000 Americans turn 65. Half of them have arthritis, 790,000 get knee replacements annually, and millions more face mobility challenges that make standard fitness programs impossible. My 78-year-old mother tried three fitness apps last month. She quit them all because "the instructor keeps going when I can't even stand up from the chair yet." She's not alone - 76% of seniors abandon fitness apps within 30 days because the pace is wrong, modifications aren't personalized, or they fear injury.

Current solutions fail spectacularly. YouTube videos can't see if you're doing it wrong. Group classes move too fast. Personal trainers cost $100/hour and aren't covered by Medicare. Physical therapy ends after 12 sessions. Seniors are left with printed exercise sheets from 1995 and told "just keep doing these at home." Meanwhile, every week without exercise increases fall risk by 12% and healthcare costs by $2,800 annually.

## The Solution

SilverFit AI uses computer vision through your phone camera to watch how you move, then adapts in real-time. Can't lift your arm past shoulder height today? The AI instantly switches to a modified movement. Struggling with balance? It adds a chair-support variation. Having a good day? It gradually increases difficulty.

The magic moment: Dorothy, 72, with two knee replacements, starts a "strength session." The app sees her struggle to stand from sitting. Instead of continuing, it says "Let's modify that" and shows a easier version using arm support. She completes it. The app celebrates her win. Next session, it remembers and starts there. After 6 weeks, she's standing unassisted - something her PT said would take months.

Early pilot with 50 seniors: 87% still active after 90 days (vs. 24% industry standard). Average improvement: 40% in sit-to-stand time, 3.2x more weekly exercise minutes, 68% reduction in reported joint pain during movement. Users save $2,400/year avoiding PT visits while maintaining function.

## Market Size

The U.S. mobility-limited senior fitness market is $18.7 billion and growing 23% annually [1]. 54 million Americans over 65 have doctor-recommended movement restrictions. They spend average $312/year on fitness solutions that don't work. 

Bottom-up: 10 million high-need seniors (joint replacements, severe arthritis) Ã— $30/month subscription = $3.6B addressable market. Another 20 million moderate-need seniors represent $7.2B expansion opportunity. Medicare Advantage plans cover 48% of seniors and desperately need solutions to reduce fall-related hospitalizations ($50 billion annual cost).

Market exploding: Senior smartphone adoption hit 61% in 2024. Medicare Advantage plans now reimburse digital fitness subscriptions. Post-COVID, 73% of seniors are comfortable with video-based healthcare.

## Business Model

$29.99/month direct-to-consumer, $19.99/month through Medicare Advantage partnerships (they pay us $24.99, user pays $19.99). Gross margins: 84% after initial AI training costs amortized.

CAC through Facebook/NextDoor: $47. LTV: $1,100 (38-month average retention in pilot). CAC through Medicare Advantage: $12 (they market for us). LTV: $1,400 (46-month retention when subsidized).

Path to $100M ARR: 10,000 users month 6, 50,000 month 12 (with 2 Medicare partnerships), 150,000 month 18 (5 partnerships), 280,000 by month 24. At month 24: 200,000 Medicare users ($60M ARR) + 80,000 direct ($29M ARR) + corporate wellness contracts ($11M) = $100M.

## Why Now?

Computer vision accurate enough for home use emerged in 2023 - MediaPipe pose detection now runs on 2018 phones at 30fps with 94% accuracy. Five years ago, this required $5,000 equipment. Today, any $200 Android phone works.

Regulatory shift: CMS approved asynchronous digital therapy reimbursement codes January 2024. Medicare Advantage plans can now pay for apps directly. Market went from "impossible to reimburse" to "actively seeking solutions" overnight.

Behavioral change: 73% of 65+ adults used telehealth in 2024 (vs. 4% in 2019). Seniors learned smartphones during COVID - average daily usage up 340%. They're ready for digital health solutions but everyone's building for millennials.

Evidence of inflection: Sword Health raised $163M at $3B valuation for employer-focused digital PT. But they ignore seniors entirely - "too complex, low smartphone adoption." That was true in 2019. It's false now.

## Competition & Moat

Direct competitors: SilverSneakers (24M members through Medicare) offers generic group classes, no personalization, 4% monthly active users. Sword Health ($3B valuation) targets employers, requires special hardware, costs $3,000/year. Future ($149/month) provides human coaches but no senior-specific programs, no real-time adaptation.

Our unfair advantage: 1) Patent-pending "adaptive difficulty algorithm" trained on 50,000 hours of senior movement data from our founder's PT clinic network. 2) Only solution with FDA Breakthrough Device designation pending for fall prevention. 3) Partnership pipeline with 5 Medicare Advantage plans covering 8M lives (former Humana VP of Digital Health is our advisor).

Defensibility: Two-sided network - more seniors using = better AI adaptations = better outcomes = easier Medicare sales. Switching costs high - users build 6-month movement history, AI learns their specific limitations. Medical-grade liability insurance ($5M policy) that competitors can't get without our clinical trial data.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Technology adoption**: Seniors might struggle with smartphone setup. Mitigation: White-glove onboarding via phone, family member setup flow, partnering with senior centers for in-person help. Pilot showed 92% successful self-setup with our guided flow.

**Regulatory changes**: Medicare could stop reimbursing digital fitness. Mitigation: Direct-to-consumer proven profitable, corporate wellness contracts diversify revenue, building evidence base for medical device approval (harder to revoke).

**Apple/Google enter market**: They have distribution but lack senior-specific expertise. Our clinical advisory board (12 leading geriatricians) and movement dataset create 3-year moat. Plus, they'll likely acquire rather than build - we're the obvious target.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 500 beta users, 80% week-4 retention
**90 days**: First Medicare Advantage LOI signed
**6 months**: 10,000 paying users, $250K MRR
**12 months**: FDA Breakthrough designation, 50,000 users, $1.2M MRR, Series A ready
