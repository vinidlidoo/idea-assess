# SilverFit AI: Adaptive fitness coaching for seniors with mobility limitations

## What We Do

SilverFit AI is an adaptive fitness app that uses computer vision and AI to create personalized exercise programs for seniors aged 65+. The app watches users through their phone camera, adjusts exercises in real-time based on their mobility range, and provides gentle corrections to prevent injury.

## The Problem

Every day, 10,000 Americans turn 65, and 71% of them have at least one mobility limitation that makes traditional fitness programs impossible [1]. Margaret, 73, from Phoenix, told researchers: "I tried three different fitness apps. They all assume I can do a full squat. I can't even bend my knee past 45 degrees." Current solutions fail because they're designed for younger bodies - YouTube fitness videos move too fast, personal trainers cost $80-150/hour, and physical therapy ends after insurance runs out. Seniors waste an average of $420/year on fitness solutions they can't use [2]. Meanwhile, every year without regular exercise increases fall risk by 35% and healthcare costs by $2,000 annually. The result: 28% of seniors fall each year, costing Medicare $50 billion in 2024 alone [3].

## The Solution

When Margaret opens SilverFit AI, the phone camera maps her range of motion in 30 seconds. The AI immediately adapts - if she can't do squats, it suggests seated leg lifts. As she moves, the app provides real-time feedback: "Lift your arm 2 inches higher" or "Great form, hold for 3 more seconds." This is 10x better because it's like having a personal trainer who never judges, never rushes, and costs 95% less. In our 12-week pilot with 50 seniors at Valley Senior Center, participants improved mobility scores by 34%, reduced fall incidents by 60%, and saved an average of $125/month compared to in-person training [4]. The magic: our computer vision model trained on 10,000+ hours of senior movement data knows exactly what modifications each person needs. Users get stronger without injury, building confidence with every perfectly-adapted session.

## Market Size

The U.S. senior fitness market reached $7.2 billion in 2024, growing at 23% annually as the 65+ population explodes from 58 million today to 95 million by 2030 [5]. Bottom-up: 18 million tech-savvy seniors Ã— $29/month subscription = $6.3 billion addressable market. The digital fitness segment specifically is growing 47% yearly as seniors became comfortable with apps during COVID. Medicare Advantage plans now cover digital fitness benefits for 28 million enrollees, creating a B2B2C opportunity worth $2.1 billion [6].

## Business Model

We charge $29/month direct-to-consumer, or $19/month through Medicare Advantage partnerships. With a CAC of $42 through targeted Facebook ads (seniors are cheap to acquire) and 14-month average retention, our LTV/CAC ratio is 8.7x. Gross margins hit 87% since we have no physical locations or equipment. Path to $100M ARR: Year 1: 5,000 users ($1.7M), Year 2: 35,000 users ($12M) via Medicare Advantage pilots, Year 3: 290,000 users ($101M) through nationwide health plan rollout. Our killer metric: each user prevents 0.8 falls per year, saving insurers $4,200 per member [7].

## Why Now?

Smartphone adoption among 65+ Americans hit 61% in 2024, up from 13% in 2014 - the market literally didn't exist before [8]. Apple's Vision framework now enables accurate pose detection on phones from 2019 onward, making our tech possible without special hardware. Medicare started covering digital therapeutics in January 2024, opening reimbursement pathways. Five years ago, seniors didn't have smartphones and insurers wouldn't pay for apps. Five years from now, every Medicare plan will require digital fitness - we're hitting the sweet spot. The inflection point: 2024 saw the first senior fitness app (Bold) hit $45M in revenue, proving the model [9].

## Competition & Moat

Bold (raised $17M, 50K users) focuses on balance training but requires a tablet and doesn't adapt exercises. SilverStrong ($8M raised, 30K users) offers live classes but costs $59/month and requires fixed schedule availability. Both miss the core insight: seniors need real-time adaptation, not just senior-themed content. Our unfair advantage: we're the only team combining geriatric physical therapy expertise (our co-founder ran Mayo Clinic's senior rehab program) with computer vision PhD research (our CTO published 12 papers on pose estimation). Our 10,000-hour senior movement dataset can't be replicated without 2+ years of collection. Network effects kick in as users share progress with family members who become customers. Competitors are strong at marketing but weak at true personalization - Bold's exercises are still one-size-fits-all within categories.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Apple/Google enter the market.** Mitigation: We're building the clinical validation they lack - FDA clearance application submitted, 3 published studies underway. BigCos won't pursue medical device pathways. **Risk 2: Seniors struggle with tech setup.** Mitigation: White-glove onboarding via phone for first 1,000 users, then video tutorials that reduced setup failures by 78% in testing. **Risk 3: Liability for exercise injuries.** Mitigation: Conservative AI that never pushes beyond detected limits, $5M insurance policy, disclaimer acknowledgments. Why hasn't Peloton done this? They're focused on high-intensity younger demographics; senior fitness requires different unit economics and go-to-market they can't pursue without cannabalizing their brand.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 500 beta users, 70% week-2 retention
**90 days**: First Medicare Advantage pilot contract signed
**6 months**: $50K MRR, 2,000 active users
**12 months**: FDA clearance obtained, $300K MRR, Series A ready
