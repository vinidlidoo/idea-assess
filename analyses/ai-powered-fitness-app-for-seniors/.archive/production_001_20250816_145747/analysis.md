# FitWise AI: AI-Powered Fitness App for Seniors with Mobility Limitations

## What We Do

FitWise AI is a fitness app that uses computer vision to guide seniors through safe exercises at home. It watches your form through your phone camera and adjusts workouts based on your mobility level. Think personal trainer that never judges and always remembers your bad knee.

## The Problem

Every day, 10,000 Americans turn 65. Half will experience mobility limitations that make traditional exercise dangerous or impossible. "I fell doing yoga from YouTube and spent three months recovering," reports Martha, 72, from Ohio. "Now I'm scared to exercise alone."

Seniors waste $4,000+ annually on unused gym memberships because equipment isn't accessible. Physical therapy costs $150/session with 6-month waitlists. Home health aides charge $30/hour but lack fitness expertise. Current fitness apps assume you can do burpees and ignore medication side effects, balance issues, or joint replacements.

The result: 28% of seniors get zero physical activity, leading to $117 billion in preventable healthcare costs. One woman told us: "I need to exercise to keep living independently, but everything assumes I'm 25 or already disabled. There's nothing in between."

## The Solution

FitWise AI starts with a 3-minute mobility assessment using your phone camera. Can you raise your arms overhead? Stand from sitting? The AI builds your personalized program instantly. 

During workouts, computer vision tracks your form in real-time. If you're losing balance during leg lifts, it switches to seated variations. If your range of motion improves over weeks, exercises gradually advance. No equipment needed beyond a chair.

Users average 47 minutes of exercise weekly after 30 days, up from 8 minutes baseline. Falls during exercise: zero in 10,000+ sessions tracked. Early pilot with 200 seniors showed 73% still actively using after 90 days versus 9% for traditional fitness apps. Medicare Advantage plans see $310/member/month reduction in costs after 6 months.

The magic: AI that actually understands physical limitations. Not "modify if needed" but specific alternatives pre-programmed for 200+ common conditions.

## Market Size

15 million seniors need adapted fitness solutions today, growing to 95 million by 2060 [1]. Medicare Advantage serves 31 million enrollees spending $13,000/year per member. Just 1% reduction in falls saves plans $4.3 billion annually.

Bottom-up: 15M seniors × $30/month subscription = $5.4B annual opportunity. Add Medicare Advantage partnerships at $50/member/month for 5M covered lives = additional $3B. Physical therapy practices pay $500/month for remote patient tools, with 200,000 potential clinics.

Digital health for seniors hit $3.7 billion in 2024, growing 32% annually. Medicare's new remote therapeutic monitoring codes now reimburse $120/month for app-based exercise programs.

## Business Model

Direct-to-consumer: $29/month or $240/year. Medicare Advantage partnership: $50/member/month for population health contracts. Physical therapy integration: $500/month per practice for remote monitoring tools.

Unit economics from comparable telehealth: CAC of $85 through Medicare channels, LTV of $1,800 (36-month average retention for senior health apps). Gross margin 87% after AWS costs. 

Path to $100M ARR: 50,000 D2C subscribers ($18M) + 100,000 Medicare Advantage lives ($60M) + 500 PT practices ($3M) + enterprise wellness programs ($20M). Achievable in 36 months based on Papa's growth trajectory (0 to $100M in 3 years serving similar demographic).

## Why Now?

Smartphone adoption among 65+ jumped from 53% to 86% between 2019-2024 [2]. COVID normalized video-based health services—telehealth usage among seniors increased 38x and stuck at 15x pre-pandemic levels. 

Five years ago: Seniors didn't have smartphones. Computer vision required $10K equipment. Medicare didn't reimburse digital therapeutics. Today: Your grandma FaceTimes, AI runs on phones, and Medicare pays for app prescriptions.

In five years: Every Medicare plan will require digital fitness benefits. The question isn't if but who owns the market. CMS just announced 2025 reimbursement codes specifically for AI-assisted exercise programs [3]. The regulatory gates just opened.

## Competition & Moat

SilverSneakers dominates with 16 million members but requires gym visits—useless for mobility-limited seniors. Bold ($20M raised) offers live classes but costs $150/month with human trainers that don't scale. Mighty Health ($5M raised) lacks real-time form correction, causing 23% injury rate per user reviews.

Our unfair advantage: 3-year head start on vision models trained specifically on senior movement patterns (not yoga influencers). Partnership pipeline with top-5 Medicare Advantage plan covering 8 million lives. Founding team includes former SilverSneakers CPO and Stanford AI lab computer vision researcher.

Defensibility: 2-year exclusive contracts with Medicare plans create switching costs. Each user's movement history creates personalized AI that improves monthly. Network effects through family sharing features—adult children monitor parent progress, driving viral growth.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

FDA regulation could require 510(k) clearance, adding 12-month delay. Mitigation: Already operating under wellness exemption, pursuing FDA registration proactively. Have regulatory advisor from Peloton's FDA clearance.

Big Tech entry (Apple Fitness+ for seniors). Mitigation: Medicare contracts lock in distribution. Our medical-grade focus versus consumer wellness creates different category.

Seniors struggle with technology setup. Mitigation: White-glove onboarding service included. Adult children can remotely configure. 92% successful self-setup in latest version versus 61% initially.

"Why hasn't UnitedHealth built this?" They're our customer, not competitor. Health plans want proven solutions, not R&D projects.
