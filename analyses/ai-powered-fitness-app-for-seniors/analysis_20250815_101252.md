# FitWise AI: AI-Powered Adaptive Fitness for Seniors with Mobility Limitations

## What We Do

FitWise AI is an AI fitness coach that adapts exercises in real-time for seniors with arthritis, joint problems, or mobility issues. Like having a personal trainer who knows exactly what your body can handle today, adjusting every movement to keep you safe while building strength.

## The Problem

"I stopped exercising after my hip replacement because every YouTube video shows exercises I can't do anymore," says Margaret, 73, from Florida. She's one of 54 million seniors facing this exact problem - traditional fitness programs that ignore their physical limitations.

The numbers are staggering: 78% of adults over 65 have at least one chronic condition limiting mobility [1]. They waste hours searching for appropriate exercises, risk injury attempting unsuitable movements, and ultimately quit. Physical therapy costs $150-350 per session, and most Medicare plans cover only 20 visits annually. Generic fitness apps show 25-year-olds doing burpees while seniors need modified chair exercises.

Current solutions fail because they're one-size-fits-all. Silver Sneakers offers group classes that can't adapt to individual limitations. YouTube requires seniors to guess which modifications are safe. Personal trainers who specialize in senior fitness charge $75-150/hour and are booked solid. Meanwhile, seniors lose 3-8% of muscle mass per decade after 30, accelerating without appropriate exercise. One fall can trigger a cascade leading to loss of independence - 30% of seniors who fall require assisted living within a year.

## The Solution

FitWise AI watches you move through your phone camera and instantly adapts. Can't raise your arm above shoulder height today? It switches to isometric holds. Knee acting up? It replaces lunges with seated leg lifts. The magic moment: when 72-year-old beta tester Robert saw the app modify his squats to chair-stands after detecting his balance wobble, saying "It noticed before I did."

This is 10x better because it provides real-time form correction previously available only from $100/hour trainers. Computer vision tracks 33 body points, detecting compensation patterns that indicate pain or limitation. Machine learning trained on 50,000+ senior exercise sessions knows that when someone shifts weight during a hip circle, they likely have lower back stiffness.

Early validation: 420 beta users, 87% still active after 90 days (industry standard: 23%). Average user increases strength test scores by 34% in 12 weeks. Falls reduced by 48% among regular users. Healthcare provider pilot with 200 patients showed $1,850 average reduction in annual medical costs through fall prevention and increased mobility.

How it works: Phone camera captures movement, pose estimation AI identifies form issues, adaptive algorithm adjusts difficulty and exercise selection in real-time, voice coach provides encouragement and corrections. No wearables needed.

## Market Size

The global senior fitness market reaches $17.2 billion in 2025, growing at 8.2% annually [2]. 73 million seniors in the US alone, with 10,000 more turning 65 daily.

Bottom-up calculation: 54 million US seniors with mobility limitations × 20% smartphone adoption × $30/month subscription = $3.9 billion addressable market in US only. Expanding globally: 1.4 billion people over 60 worldwide by 2030.

This market is exploding because the 65+ demographic is the fastest-growing age segment, increasing 38% by 2030. Smartphone adoption among seniors jumped from 18% to 42% between 2019-2024. Medicare Advantage plans now cover digital fitness benefits, creating reimbursement pathways. The pandemic normalized video-based healthcare, with telehealth usage among seniors increasing 300%.

## Business Model

We charge $29.99/month direct-to-consumer, with $199/year option. Medicare Advantage partnerships at $15/member/month for covered lives.

Unit economics: CAC of $45 through targeted Facebook/NextDoor campaigns (seniors engage 10x more than average). LTV of $720 (24-month average retention at current metrics). Gross margin 82% after cloud infrastructure costs. At 150,000 subscribers, we hit $54M ARR. Path to $100M: 280,000 subscribers achievable by year 3 given current growth rate of 1,800 users/month.

This model wins through network effects - users share with friends at senior centers, creating viral loops with 3.2 referral coefficient. Medicare Advantage creates massive distribution - one partnership with Humana reaches 5 million eligible seniors. B2B2C model reduces CAC to near zero for covered members.

## Why Now?

Computer vision APIs cost dropped 95% since 2019 - what required $50,000 in computational resources now costs $500/month. Pose estimation accuracy crossed 95% threshold in 2024, finally reliable enough for medical-grade movement tracking.

Five years ago, impossible: Phones lacked processing power for real-time pose estimation. Seniors had 18% smartphone adoption. No pose estimation models trained on older bodies. Medicare wouldn't reimburse digital solutions.

Five years from now, inevitable: Every Medicare plan will cover digital fitness. AI movement analysis will be standard in all fitness apps. The senior demographic will be 25% of the population.

The inflection is happening NOW: CMS approved digital therapeutic reimbursement codes in January 2024 [3]. Apple's Vision Pro sparked $4.2 billion investment in computer vision fitness tech in 2024. Insurance companies desperately seek preventive solutions - every dollar spent on senior fitness saves $4.30 in medical costs.

## Competition & Moat

Direct competitors: SilverSneakers (8 million members, $400M revenue) offers gym access and generic online classes but zero personalization. Bold ($15M funding, 50,000 users) provides digital senior fitness but uses pre-recorded videos without adaptation. Fitness Blender for Seniors (100,000 users) offers free videos but no AI, no form checking, no customization.

Our unfair advantage: 18-month head start on senior-specific movement AI training. Partnership with Mayo Clinic for clinical validation (competitors lack medical credibility). Proprietary dataset of 50,000+ senior exercise sessions with physical therapist annotations. Our founder's mother broke her hip doing inappropriate exercises - deep personal mission drives 10x faster iteration than corporate competitors.

Defensibility comes from data network effects - every user improves the AI's understanding of senior movement patterns. Switching costs are high once users trust the system with their safety. Medical partnerships take 12-18 months to establish, creating massive moats. We move fast - shipping weekly while competitors update quarterly.

SilverSneakers is strong in gym partnerships but weak in digital experience. Bold has good content but no real-time adaptation. We win by being the only solution that truly sees and responds to each user's unique limitations.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Top 3 existential risks: 1) Apple or Google adds senior fitness to their health apps. Mitigation: Focus on medical-grade accuracy and healthcare partnerships they won't pursue due to liability. 2) Injury liability if AI misses dangerous form. Mitigation: Insurance policy, disclaimers, conservative algorithm that favors safety over intensity. 3) Senior tech adoption plateaus. Mitigation: Family member app allows children to monitor parent's exercise, expanding our buyer persona.

Why hasn't Apple done this? They focus on general population, not medical-grade senior solutions. Liability concerns prevent them from targeting vulnerable populations. Our clinical partnerships and FDA clearance pathway (in progress) create regulatory moat.

Unique insight: Everyone focuses on senior tech literacy as the barrier. The real barrier is trust - seniors don't trust generic apps with their safety. Our medical partnerships and conservative AI build that trust.
