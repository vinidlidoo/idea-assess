# FitWise AI: AI-Powered Fitness Companion for Active Aging

## What We Do

FitWise AI creates personalized exercise programs for adults over 65 with mobility challenges. Our AI watches you move through your phone camera, adjusts exercises in real-time, and keeps you safe while building strength. Think of it as a physical therapist that lives in your phone and costs 95% less.

## The Problem

Every day, 10,000 Americans turn 65. Half of them will experience a fall this year, costing them $50,000 in medical bills on average [1]. Margaret, 72, from Phoenix told us: "I stopped exercising after hip surgery because I'm terrified of falling again. My physical therapist costs $150 per session and I can only afford once a week."

The current solutions fail seniors catastrophically. Generic fitness apps like Peloton assume you can do burpees and mountain climbers. Physical therapy costs $150-300 per session with 6-week wait times. Senior centers offer group classes that ignore individual limitations. YouTube videos can't see if you're doing movements wrong, risking injury.

78% of seniors want to exercise but don't because they fear injury, can't afford professional help, or don't know what's safe for their specific conditions [2]. They're literally choosing immobility over the risk of doing the wrong exercise.

## The Solution

Here's the magic moment: Grandma opens FitWise, holds up her phone, and does a 30-second movement assessment. Our computer vision AI instantly identifies her range of motion, balance issues, and strength limitations. Within seconds, she has a personalized 10-minute routine that's safe for her specific body.

As she exercises, the AI watches through the camera, counting reps and correcting form: "Raise your knee a bit higher, Martha!" When it detects struggle, it automatically adjusts: "Let's modify that - try holding the chair for support."

This is 10x better because it provides real-time form correction that prevents injuries, costs $9.99/month instead of $600/month for twice-weekly PT, and adapts daily based on energy levels and progress. Early pilot with 50 users showed 73% reduction in fear of exercise, 89% adherence after 30 days (versus 23% for generic apps), and average strength improvement of 34% in 8 weeks.

The AI uses pose estimation models to track 33 body points at 30fps, comparing movements against safe ranges for specific age groups and conditions.

## Market Size

The global digital health market for seniors will reach $296 billion by 2025, growing at 38% annually [3]. In the US alone, 54 million adults over 65 represent a $67 billion fitness market opportunity.

Bottom-up: 54M US seniors × 30% with mobility limitations × 20% smartphone adoption × $120 annual subscription = $389M immediate addressable market. Medicare Advantage plans covering 27M seniors are desperately seeking preventive solutions that reduce fall-related hospitalizations.

The senior fitness app market specifically is exploding from $1.2B in 2023 to projected $8.4B by 2028 [4]. Insurance reimbursement for digital therapeutics just became standard, opening a B2B2C channel that didn't exist 18 months ago.

## Business Model

Direct-to-consumer at $9.99/month, with annual plans at $79. Medicare Advantage partnerships at $25/member/month (they save $15,000 per prevented fall).

Unit economics: CAC of $23 through senior Facebook groups, LTV of $247 (average 24.7-month retention), 87% gross margin. At 5,000 users/month growth rate, we hit $10M ARR in month 18, $100M ARR by year 4.

The killer metric: every prevented fall saves Medicare $31,000. With just 10% reduction in falls among our users, we save the healthcare system $167M annually per 100,000 users. Medicare Advantage plans will pay anything for those numbers.

## Why Now?

Smartphones with quality cameras just hit 61% penetration among 65+ adults in 2024, up from 13% in 2019 [5]. Pose estimation AI models became accurate enough for medical-grade movement analysis only in 2023 with Google's MediaPipe hitting 95% accuracy.

Five years ago, seniors didn't have smartphones and AI couldn't reliably track movement. Five years from now, every Medicare plan will require digital fitness apps for fall prevention. We're at the perfect intersection.

The pandemic taught seniors to use technology - Zoom adoption among 65+ jumped from 7% to 71%. CMS just approved reimbursement codes for "digital therapeutic exercise programs" in October 2024. The iPhone 15's LiDAR sensor enables depth perception that makes our form detection 10x more accurate.

## Competition & Moat

**Direct competitors**: SilverSneakers (24M members but no personalization, just generic classes), Bold ($7M raised, 10K users, requires expensive bands/equipment), Nymbl (balance only, no strength, $4M raised but pivoting to enterprise).

Our unfair advantage: founding team includes former Apple Health CV engineer and Johns Hopkins geriatric research lead. We have proprietary dataset of 50,000 senior movement patterns from NIH partnership. Our AI model is specifically trained on older adult biomechanics, not young athletes.

Defensibility comes from network effects (users contribute movement data that improves AI), switching costs (6 months of progress history and personalized programs), and speed. While competitors debate features, we're already in pilot with Humana covering 2,000 members.

Yes, Apple Fitness+ could add senior features, but they're focused on high-ARPU young professionals. Their UI complexity alone makes them unsuitable for our demographic.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: FDA regulation** - We stay in wellness category, not making medical claims. Already consulting with FDA regulatory attorney.

**Risk 2: Senior tech adoption** - Onboarding designed with AARP UX guidelines, phone support included, family member setup option.

**Risk 3: Camera privacy concerns** - All processing happens on-device, no video stored, HIPAA compliant infrastructure ready.

"Why hasn't Amazon/Google done this?" They have - Google bought Fitbit for $2.1B but abandoned senior features for younger demographic with higher CLV. Amazon Halo shuttered because they couldn't crack healthcare distribution. We start where they failed: Medicare Advantage partnerships from day one.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 500 beta users, 70% week-2 retention
**90 days**: $50K MRR, Humana pilot launch
**6 months**: $200K MRR, 10,000 active users
**12 months**: $1M MRR, Series A metrics: 50K users, 3 enterprise contracts
