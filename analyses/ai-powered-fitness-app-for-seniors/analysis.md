# SilverFit AI: AI-powered fitness app for seniors with mobility limitations

## What We Do

SilverFit AI creates personalized exercise programs for adults 65+ using computer vision to monitor form, prevent falls, and adapt workouts in real-time. Works on any smartphone or tablet, no wearables required.

## The Problem

Every year, 28% of seniors fall, resulting in $50 billion in medical costs and 32,000 deaths [1]. Traditional fitness solutions fail older adults catastrophically. Group classes move too fast. Personal trainers cost $75/hour. YouTube videos can't see when your knee buckles or balance wavers.

"I tried following along with a video, but I couldn't tell if I was doing it right. Then I fell trying to do a lunge. Six weeks in physical therapy," reports Margaret Chen, 72, from Sacramento. The average senior spends 164 days per year inactive due to fear of injury [2]. Medicare covers only 20 physical therapy sessions annually, leaving millions undertrained and vulnerable. Current apps like Peloton or Apple Fitness+ assume users can perform standard movements—impossible for 41% of seniors with arthritis or mobility issues.

## The Solution

SilverFit AI watches you exercise through your phone camera, providing real-time corrections like a physical therapist. User opens app, props phone against wall, follows 15-minute routine. AI detects compensatory movements, stops exercises before form breaks down, suggests easier modifications instantly.

In beta testing with 312 seniors, users averaged 4.2 sessions weekly (vs 1.3 for generic fitness apps). Fall rates decreased 67% over 90 days. Time-to-first-exercise: 47 seconds. No setup, no equipment, no confusion.

The AI uses pose estimation models fine-tuned on 50,000+ hours of senior movement data, recognizing 27 mobility impairments. When detecting instability, it immediately switches to seated alternatives. Users report feeling "like my PT is right there with me."

## Market Size

34 million Americans aged 65-74 spend $4.5 trillion annually, with fitness expenditures reaching $112 billion in 2024 [3]. The senior fitness app market hit $1.8 billion in 2024, growing 34% year-over-year.

Bottom-up: 54 million seniors × 30% smartphone adoption × $20/month = $3.9B addressable market. Medicare Advantage plans cover 31 million seniors, increasingly reimbursing preventive fitness tech. Every 1% market penetration = $39M ARR. The 65+ population grows by 10,000 daily through 2030.

## Business Model

$19.99/month direct-to-consumer, $12/month through Medicare Advantage partnerships. CAC of $67 through targeted Facebook campaigns (seniors are 3x more responsive than younger demographics). LTV of $852 with 71% gross margins after cloud costs.

Path to $100M: 10,000 users (Year 1), 85,000 users via 3 Medicare Advantage deals (Year 2), 420,000 users through national partnership (Year 3). Users stay 3.5x longer than standard fitness apps due to injury prevention value. At scale, each AI inference costs $0.003, margins expand to 84%.

## Why Now?

Smartphone adoption among 65+ crossed 61% in 2024, up from 13% in 2015 [4]. Edge AI inference now runs real-time pose detection on 5-year-old phones. Medicare added CPT codes for digital therapeutics reimbursement January 2024.

Five years ago: smartphones couldn't process video locally, seniors didn't trust apps, Medicare wouldn't pay. Five years forward: preventive digital health becomes mandatory for insurers as senior population doubles. 2024 marks the inflection—COVID normalized video-first healthcare, Meta's new pose models dropped inference costs 90%, and United Healthcare announced $2B digital health fund specifically for senior solutions [5].

## Competition & Moat

**Bold** (50K users, $8M raised) offers video classes but no personalization—one-size-fits-all approach causes injuries. **Silver Sneakers** (2M users through gyms) requires leaving home, impossible for 31% of mobility-impaired seniors. **Lark Health** ($70M raised) focuses on chronic disease, ignoring physical fitness.

Our moat: proprietary dataset of senior movement patterns no competitor can replicate. We've recorded 2M+ exercise sessions, building AI that recognizes pre-fall indicators 4.3 seconds before occurrence. Switching costs compound—users trust our AI with their safety after preventing their first near-fall. 

Network effects emerge through family sharing—adult children monitor parent progress, creating 2.7x retention. Our clinical validation study (n=5,000) publishes March 2025, enabling medical device classification competitors can't achieve for 24+ months.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1**: Apple/Google enter market. Mitigation: Medical device approval creates 2-year regulatory moat, Medicare contracts lock in distribution.

**Risk 2**: Seniors reject AI coaching. Mitigation: Frame as "smart physical therapy," not AI. Beta users already refer friends at 34% rate.

**Risk 3**: Liability from exercise injuries. Mitigation: $5M insurance policy, disclaimers, AI stops exercises at first sign of instability.

Why hasn't Peloton done this? They chase high-spending 30-somethings, not Medicare reimbursements. Their instructors can't personalize to 27 different mobility conditions. We're building the unsexy business they'll acquire for $2B in 36 months.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 1,000 beta users, 70% week-2 retention
**90 days**: First Medicare Advantage pilot contract signed
**6 months**: 10,000 paying users, $200K MRR
**12 months**: $5M ARR, 50K users, Series A metrics achieved
