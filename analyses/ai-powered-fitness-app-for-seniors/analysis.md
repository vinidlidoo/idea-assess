# SilverFit AI: AI-powered fitness app for seniors with mobility limitations

## What We Do

SilverFit AI is a fitness application that uses computer vision and AI to guide seniors through safe, personalized exercises at home. The app watches users through their phone camera, corrects form in real-time, and adapts workouts based on mobility limitations and progress.

## The Problem

"I fell doing YouTube exercises and spent three months in rehab. There was no one to tell me I was doing it wrong." - Martha, 73, fell attempting unsupervised squats at home. She's one of 3 million seniors who fall each year, with 20% resulting in serious injury [1]. Medicare spends $50 billion annually on fall-related injuries, yet 77% of seniors want to exercise at home rather than in facilities.

Current solutions fail catastrophically. Generic fitness apps ignore arthritis, joint replacements, and balance issues. YouTube videos can't see if you're compensating dangerously. Physical therapy costs $150/session and requires transportation that 5.5 million seniors lack. Senior centers only reach 15% of the eligible population. The result: 28% of seniors get zero physical activity, accelerating decline into dependency. One user told us: "I need someone watching me RIGHT NOW, not next Thursday at 2 PM when my PT appointment is."

## The Solution

Users prop their phone on a table, and SilverFit AI becomes their personal trainer. The magic moment: "Stop! You're leaning too far left. Let me show you." The AI catches dangerous form before injury occurs, using pose estimation to track 33 body points at 30fps. When Margaret, 71, starts chair squats, the app notices her right knee buckling inward and immediately adjusts: "Let's modify this - hold the chair back for support."

It's 10x better because it prevents falls rather than treating them. Early pilots with 200 seniors showed 73% reduction in exercise-related injuries, 4.2x higher adherence than YouTube videos, and average strength improvements of 31% in 12 weeks. The app maintains detailed profiles of each user's limitations - if you've had hip replacement, it knows never to suggest certain movements. Real-time form correction means users exercise confidently without fear. Cost: $19/month versus $600/month for twice-weekly PT sessions.

## Market Size

The U.S. has 54 million adults over 65, projected to reach 95 million by 2060 [2]. With 77% wanting home exercise solutions and average spending of $273/year on fitness, that's a $11.4 billion addressable market growing 18% annually. Medicare Advantage plans cover 31 million seniors and desperately seek preventive solutions to reduce their $50 billion fall-related costs.

Bottom-up: 10,000 users at $228/year (our annual plan) = $2.3M ARR. At 100,000 users (0.18% of market) = $23M ARR. The senior fitness app market grew 47% in 2024 alone [3], driven by smartphone adoption among seniors reaching 67%. This isn't about capturing market share - it's about creating a new category of AI-supervised senior fitness.

## Business Model

Direct-to-consumer at $19/month or $228/year, with Medicare Advantage partnerships for bulk subscriptions. CAC through Facebook is $42 (seniors are active there), with LTV of $684 based on 36-month average retention. Gross margins are 87% - it's software with minimal compute costs per user.

Path to $100M ARR: Year 1: 10K users ($2.3M), Year 2: 50K users ($11.4M) + 3 Medicare Advantage pilots, Year 3: 200K direct users + 100K through 10 MA plans ($68M), Year 4: 500K users hitting $100M. The killer metric: every prevented fall saves Medicare $39,000. One Medicare Advantage plan with 500K members could drive $5M ARR alone while saving them $50M+ annually.

## Why Now?

Smartphone adoption among 65+ hit 67% in 2024, up from 42% in 2019 [4]. Computer vision on mobile became viable with Apple's Neural Engine and Qualcomm's Hexagon DSP - real-time pose estimation now runs at 30fps on phones from 2020 onward. Five years ago, this required expensive depth cameras and desktop processing.

The pandemic permanently changed senior behavior - telehealth visits increased 38x and stayed at 15x pre-pandemic levels. Medicare started reimbursing digital therapeutics in 2023. The collision of technical capability, user adoption, and reimbursement policy creates a window that won't last - Big Tech will eventually notice this $50 billion problem.

## Competition & Moat

Bold ($15/month, 50K users) offers pre-recorded senior workouts but no form correction - users still get hurt. SilverAge Fitness ($99/year, 100K users) has live Zoom classes but can't scale instructors or see individual form clearly. Nymbl ($29/month, 30K users) focuses only on balance training, missing strength and flexibility.

Our moat is 18 months of senior-specific movement data from 200,000+ sessions, enabling our AI to recognize compensation patterns specific to conditions like osteoarthritis and joint replacements. This data advantage compounds - every session improves safety detection. Traditional fitness apps would need to rebuild their entire computer vision stack for senior biomechanics. Our 93-year-old beta tester told Peloton's CEO at a conference: "Your app tried to kill me."

Speed advantage: We're already in Medicare Advantage discussions while competitors focus on consumer subscriptions.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**FDA regulation**: Digital therapeutics may require clearance. Mitigation: Operating initially as wellness app (no claims to treat/diagnose), pursuing FDA De Novo pathway in parallel. Similar apps received clearance in 8-12 months.

**Liability from injuries**: Someone will get hurt and sue. Mitigation: Comprehensive waivers, liability insurance, never override medical advice. Our injury rate (0.3%) is 10x lower than unsupervised exercise.

**Apple/Google integration**: They could add this to Apple Fitness+/Google Fit. Reality: They've ignored seniors for a decade. Their brand promise is aspirational fitness, not medical safety. By the time they notice, we'll have Medicare contracts they can't easily replicate.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Launch paid pilot with 500 users from waitlist
**90 days**: Achieve 2,000 paying subscribers, injury rate below 0.5%
**6 months**: Close first Medicare Advantage pilot (5,000 covered lives)
**12 months**: 10,000 paying users, $200K MRR, Series A metrics achieved
