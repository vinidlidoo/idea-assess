# FitWise AI: AI-Powered Fitness Coaching for Seniors with Mobility Limitations

## What We Do

FitWise AI is a mobile fitness app that uses computer vision to guide seniors through safe, personalized exercises at home. The app watches your form through your phone camera and adjusts workouts in real-time based on your mobility level, like having a physical therapist in your pocket.

## The Problem

Every year, 3 million seniors visit emergency rooms due to fall-related injuries, costing Medicare $50 billion annually [1]. The core problem: 77% of adults over 65 don't meet minimum physical activity guidelines, accelerating muscle loss (sarcopenia) that affects 30% of seniors [2]. Traditional solutions fail because gym memberships require transportation many seniors lack, personal trainers cost $60-100/hour, and generic YouTube videos can't adapt to arthritis, joint replacements, or balance issues.

"I'm scared to exercise alone since my hip surgery. What if I fall? What if I'm doing it wrong?" - Martha, 72, represents millions who need guided movement but can't access it. Physical therapy ends after 12 weeks post-surgery, leaving seniors unsupported during the critical maintenance phase when 65% experience functional decline [3].

## The Solution

Users set up their phone camera, and FitWise AI's computer vision analyzes their movement in real-time. When Martha attempts a seated leg raise, the app detects her limited range of motion and immediately adjusts: "Great start! Let's modify to heel slides instead." The magic moment: seniors realize they can exercise safely without fear.

Our 10x improvement: traditional apps show videos; we watch you move. Early pilots with 200 seniors showed 87% adherence after 3 months versus 23% for video-based apps [4]. Users averaged 4.2 sessions weekly, reducing fall risk scores by 35% in 12 weeks. The AI tracks 25 body points, detecting compensation patterns that indicate pain or instability, automatically adjusting difficulty and exercise selection. Average time to first successful workout: 8 minutes.

## Market Size

The global digital fitness market for seniors will reach $14.8 billion by 2026, growing at 23% CAGR [5]. Bottom-up calculation: 54 million US seniors × 30% smartphone adoption × $30/month subscription = $5.8 billion addressable market. Medicare Advantage plans, covering 28 million seniors, increasingly reimburse preventive fitness programs.

The senior fitness app market specifically is exploding from $1.2 billion (2023) to projected $4.7 billion (2028) as the 65+ population grows by 10,000 daily [6]. Early movers like Silver Sneakers captured 13 million members through insurance partnerships, proving massive distribution potential.

## Business Model

Direct-to-consumer subscription at $29.99/month, with Medicare Advantage reimbursement reducing effective cost to $0 for covered members. B2B2C channel through health plans at $8/member/month for population health management.

Unit economics: CAC of $45 through Medicare channels, LTV of $720 (24-month average retention), 68% gross margin after cloud costs. Path to $100M ARR: 10,000 paying users year 1, 50,000 year 2 via 3 Medicare Advantage partnerships, 280,000 users by year 3 as we prove 32% reduction in fall-related claims. The killer metric: every 1% reduction in falls saves Medicare plans $500 million annually.

## Why Now?

The iPhone 12 (2020) introduced LiDAR sensors enabling accurate 3D body tracking without expensive equipment. Pose estimation models now run efficiently on-device (MoveNet achieves 30+ FPS on phones). Meanwhile, the pandemic normalized video-based healthcare for seniors - telehealth adoption among 65+ jumped from 4% to 43% [7].

Five years ago, computer vision required cloud processing (too slow), smartphones lacked depth sensors, and seniors weren't digitally ready. Today, 61% of seniors own smartphones, up from 18% in 2019 [8]. CMS now reimburses remote therapeutic monitoring (RTM) codes, creating a $3.2 billion reimbursement pool that didn't exist pre-2022.

## Competition & Moat

Direct competitors include Silver Sneakers (13M users via insurance, $300M revenue) which offers only pre-recorded classes without personalization. Yoga Vista (50K users, $3M ARR) targets seniors but lacks real-time form correction. Bold ($8M raised, 10K users) provides balance training but requires specialized equipment costing $299.

Our unfair advantage: proprietary dataset of 500,000+ senior movement patterns from research partnerships with three physical therapy clinics. This data trains our AI to recognize compensation patterns specific to common senior conditions (hip replacements, Parkinson's, neuropathy). Competitors using generic pose models miss 40% of problematic movements in seniors. Our 18-month head start in senior-specific AI training creates a compounding data moat - every user session improves the model. Network effects emerge as users share progress with family members who become accountability partners and eventual users.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Risk 1: FDA regulation of AI health claims. Mitigation: Position as wellness/fitness (not medical device), similar to Peloton's FDA-exempt status. Already consulting with regulatory attorneys who cleared similar apps.

Risk 2: Seniors struggling with technology setup. Mitigation: White-glove onboarding via video call for first 1,000 users, building automated setup wizard based on common friction points. Current testing shows 73% successful self-setup.

Risk 3: Apple or Google entering the space. Mitigation: They lack healthcare distribution channels and senior-specific training data. Our Medicare Advantage partnerships create switching costs they can't quickly replicate. The key insight: tech giants avoid the regulatory complexity of senior healthcare, preferring younger demographics.
