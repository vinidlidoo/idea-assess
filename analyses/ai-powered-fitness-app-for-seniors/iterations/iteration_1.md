# SilverFit AI: Physical Therapy-Grade Exercise for Every Senior at Home

## What We Do

SilverFit AI delivers personalized physical therapy exercises through smartphones and tablets, using computer vision to ensure seniors perform movements safely. Our AI watches each rep, corrects form in real-time, and adapts difficulty based on mobility levelslike having a physical therapist available 24/7 for $19/month instead of $150/session.

## The Problem

Medicare covers only 20 physical therapy visits annually, yet 28% of seniors need ongoing movement therapy for chronic conditions. "I stopped PT after insurance ran out, then fell twice," reports Margaret Chen, 74, from Austin. The average senior loses $4,200 yearly from falls requiring medical care, while 31% become homebound after hip fractures. Traditional solutions fail because in-person PT costs $150/session out-of-pocket, generic YouTube videos can't correct dangerous form errors, and group classes require transportation that 5.5 million seniors lack. Last week, Robert Thompson, 81, called his daughter crying: "I need to strengthen my legs but I'm terrified of falling again doing exercises wrong."

## The Solution

Seniors open our app, position their phone camera, and follow along as our AI coach demonstrates exercises tailored to their mobility level. The magic happens when computer vision analyzes their movement frame-by-frameif their knee tracks incorrectly during a squat, the app immediately says "bring your knee back over your ankle" with visual guides. Early beta users complete 4.2x more exercise sessions than with printed sheets. Dr. Sarah Mitchell's geriatric clinic reported 73% reduction in fall incidents among 200 patients using our prototype for 12 weeks. The system works by combining OpenPose skeletal tracking with a proprietary biomechanics model trained on 50,000 hours of PT sessions, delivering accuracy within 3 degrees of professional goniometer measurements.

## Market Size

The global digital therapeutics market for seniors reaches $23.6 billion in 2024, growing 31% annually [1]. Bottom-up: 54 million US seniors � 31% needing movement therapy � $228 annual spending = $3.8 billion addressable market. The senior fitness app segment specifically grows 47% yearly as smartphone adoption among 65+ reaches 61% in 2024. Blue Shield California just announced covering digital PT apps, signaling insurance reimbursement is imminentpotentially exploding our TAM to $11 billion.

## Business Model

We charge $19/month for unlimited AI-guided sessions, compared to $150 for single in-person PT visits. With $8 CAC through Medicare Advantage partnerships and 18-month average retention, we achieve $342 LTV and 76% gross margins. Path to $100M ARR: 10,000 users Year 1 through two clinic partnerships, 100,000 Year 2 via Medicare Advantage channels, 440,000 by Year 3 as insurance coverage kicks in. Network effects emerge as seniors share progress with family members who become paying care-circle subscribers.

## Why Now?

Computer vision accuracy crossed the clinical threshold in 2024MediaPipe now achieves 96% accuracy in pose detection on standard phone cameras. Five years ago, this required $5,000 depth cameras. Simultaneously, CMS approved reimbursement codes for "digital therapeutic exercise programs" starting January 2024, while senior smartphone adoption hit 61% (versus 23% in 2019). The pandemic normalized telehealth for seniorsvirtual visit acceptance jumped from 11% to 78%. This week, Apple announced expanding their fall detection API, enabling deeper integration possibilities.

## Competition & Moat

Bold (raised $17M, 15,000 users) offers video classes but lacks real-time form correctionusers still get injured from poor technique. Sword Health ($2B valuation, 50,000 users) requires proprietary hardware sensors costing $300, limiting adoption. MedRhythms focuses only on neurological conditions, missing the broader mobility market. Our unfair advantage: proprietary dataset of 50,000 annotated PT sessions from partnership with ATI Physical Therapy, plus Dr. Jennifer Adams (Johns Hopkins geriatric PT researcher) as co-founder. We achieve 3-degree measurement accuracy using only phone camerascompetitors need external sensors. Switching costs compound as our AI learns each user's specific limitations and progress history. Bold's hardware-agnostic approach validates the model but their generic videos can't prevent injury.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

FDA regulation could require 510(k) clearance, adding 12-18 months to market. We're launching as a wellness app while simultaneously pursuing FDA approval for medical claims. Liability from exercise injuries threatens the business modelwe cap liability through terms of service, require physician clearance for high-risk users, and carry $5M professional liability insurance. Senior tech adoption remains challenging despite improvements. We address this with voice-first interface, family member onboarding programs, and partnerships with senior centers for in-person training. If Apple or Google entered with free offerings, we'd pivot to B2B2C through health systems where our clinical validation matters more than consumer brand.

## Milestones
