# SilverFit AI: Physical Therapy-Grade Exercise for Every Senior at Home

## What We Do

SilverFit AI is an AI physical therapist for seniors at home. We use smartphone cameras to watch seniors exercise, correct their form in real-time, and prevent fallsdelivering personalized physical therapy for $19/month instead of $150/session.

## The Problem

Medicare covers only 20 physical therapy visits annually, yet 28% of seniors need ongoing movement therapy for chronic conditions. "I stopped PT after insurance ran out, then fell twice," reports Margaret Chen, 74, from Austin. The average senior loses $4,200 yearly from falls requiring medical care, while 31% become homebound after hip fractures. Traditional solutions fail because in-person PT costs $150/session out-of-pocket, generic YouTube videos can't correct dangerous form errors, and group classes require transportation that 5.5 million seniors lack. Last week, Robert Thompson, 81, called his daughter crying: "I need to strengthen my legs but I'm terrified of falling again doing exercises wrong."

## The Solution

Seniors open our app, position their phone camera, and follow along as our AI coach demonstrates exercises tailored to their mobility level. The magic happens when computer vision analyzes their movement frame-by-frameif their knee tracks incorrectly during a squat, the app immediately says "bring your knee back over your ankle" with visual guides. Early beta users complete 4.2x more exercise sessions than with printed sheets. Dr. Sarah Mitchell's geriatric clinic reported 73% reduction in fall incidents among 200 patients using our prototype for 12 weeks. The system achieves clinical-grade accuracy by combining MediaPipe's skeletal tracking with our proprietary error correction model that learns from every user interaction, improving form detection for the entire user base.

## Market Size

The global digital therapeutics market for seniors reaches $23.6 billion in 2024, growing 31% annually [1]. Bottom-up: 54 million US seniors � 31% needing movement therapy � $19/month � 12 months � 15% achievable penetration = $570 million addressable market. This assumes conservative willingness-to-pay based on current senior spending of $312 annually on fitness apps and home exercise equipment [2]. The senior fitness app segment grows 47% yearly as smartphone adoption among 65+ reaches 61% in 2024. Blue Shield California's new coverage for digital PT apps signals insurance reimbursement is imminentpotentially expanding our TAM to $2.8 billion.

## Business Model

We charge $19/month for unlimited AI-guided sessions, with family care-circle subscriptions at $9/month for monitoring and encouragement features. Based on comparable digital health companies like Omada ($45 CAC) and Noom ($50 CAC), we project $40 CAC through Medicare Advantage partnerships initially, improving to $25 as we prove outcomes. With 18-month average retention at $19/month, we achieve $342 LTV and 68% gross margins after infrastructure costs. Path to $100M ARR: 5,000 users Year 1 through direct-to-consumer, 50,000 Year 2 via Medicare Advantage pilots, 440,000 by Year 3 as we demonstrate 40% reduction in fall-related claims, unlocking full MA partnerships.

## Why Now?

Computer vision accuracy crossed the clinical threshold in 2024MediaPipe now achieves 96% accuracy in pose detection on standard phone cameras. Five years ago, this required $5,000 depth cameras. Simultaneously, CMS approved CPT codes 99091, 99453, and 99454 for remote therapeutic monitoring, reimbursing $50-120 monthly per patient starting January 2024 [3]. Senior smartphone adoption hit 61% (versus 23% in 2019). The pandemic normalized telehealth for seniorsvirtual visit acceptance jumped from 11% to 78%. This week, Apple announced expanding their fall detection API, enabling deeper integration possibilities.

## Competition & Moat

Bold (raised $17M, 15,000 users) offers video classes but lacks real-time form correctionusers still get injured from poor technique. Sword Health ($2B valuation, 50,000 users) requires proprietary hardware sensors costing $300, limiting adoption. MedRhythms focuses only on neurological conditions, missing the broader mobility market. Our unfair advantage: we're first to crack sub-3-degree measurement accuracy using only phone cameras through our proprietary biomechanical constraint model that understands how joints must move together. Each user interaction improves our systemafter 50,000 sessions, we predict and prevent dangerous movements 200ms before they occur, something Bold's static videos can never achieve. Network effects compound as family members join care circles, creating switching costs through social accountability. While Google could build the computer vision, they lack our dataset of senior-specific movement patterns and the trust relationships with geriatric PT clinics essential for medical credibility.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

FDA regulation for fall prevention claims requires 510(k) clearance, adding 12-18 months and $250,000 to our timeline. We launch as an "exercise companion" making no medical claims while simultaneously pursuing FDA approval with our clinical trial data. Our legal team confirms we can market general wellness benefits without FDA approval. Liability from exercise injuries threatens the business modelwe require physician clearance for users over 80, implement conservative progression algorithms that advance 50% slower than in-person PT, and carry $5M professional liability insurance. Senior tech adoption remains challengingwe address this with voice-first interface achieving 89% command recognition, family member onboarding earning $50 referral credits, and partnerships with 200 senior centers for quarterly training sessions. If Apple entered with a free offering, our B2B2C contracts with health systems provide defensibility where clinical validation and Medicare billing capabilities matter more than consumer features.
