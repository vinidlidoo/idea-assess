# FitWise AI: AI-Powered Fitness Coaching for Seniors with Mobility Limitations

## What We Do

FitWise AI is a fitness app that uses computer vision to guide seniors through safe, personalized exercises at home. Like having a physical therapist in your phone, it watches your form, adapts to your limitations, and prevents injuries.

## The Problem

Every year, 3 million seniors visit emergency rooms due to fall-related injuries, costing Medicare $50 billion annually [1]. Traditional fitness solutions fail this population catastrophically. Gym memberships assume mobility that 40% of seniors lack. YouTube videos can't see when someone's form risks injury. Physical therapy costs $150/session and requires transportation many seniors don't have.

"I stopped exercising after my hip replacement because I was terrified of falling again," reports Maria, 72, from Phoenix. "My daughter bought me a Peloton, but I can't even get on it." This is the reality for 54 million Americans over 65 who need movement to maintain independence but face barriers everywhere. Current "senior fitness" apps are just regular apps with larger fonts - they don't address balance issues, joint replacements, or medication-induced dizziness that define senior fitness needs.

## The Solution

FitWise AI uses your phone's camera to create a real-time movement coach. Setup takes 3 minutes: prop your phone up, stand back, and the AI assesses your range of motion, balance, and strength. Within one session, users get their first "magic moment" - the app catches and corrects a dangerous movement before it causes pain.

The 10x improvement: we prevent injuries instead of just prescribing exercises. Our computer vision model, trained on 100,000+ senior movement patterns, detects compensation patterns that precede falls with 94% accuracy. When user testing with 50 seniors at assisted living facilities, we reduced exercise-related pain reports by 73% while increasing activity levels by 2.5x compared to standard video programs.

The app generates daily 10-minute routines that adapt in real-time. If it detects knee instability during squats, it instantly switches to seated variations. Sessions improve strength (31% increase in sit-to-stand speed after 8 weeks), balance (42% improvement in single-leg stance time), and confidence (89% report feeling "much safer" exercising alone).

## Market Size

The global senior fitness market reaches $17.2 billion in 2024, growing at 8.2% annually through 2030 [2]. In the US alone, 73 million adults over 60 represent immediate addressable market. Breaking it down: 20 million seniors actively seek fitness solutions Ã— $30/month subscription = $7.2 billion annual opportunity.

The market is exploding now. Medicare Advantage plans, covering 31 million seniors, added fitness benefits as standard coverage in 2024. These plans reimburse $40-60/month for qualified digital fitness programs. The infrastructure for distribution and payment exists today at scale. By 2030, the 65+ population will hit 95 million, with 70% owning smartphones capable of running AI applications.

## Business Model

We charge $29/month direct-to-consumer or $19/month through Medicare Advantage partnerships. Initial pilots with two MA plans show CAC of $35 through their member channels versus $180 through Facebook ads. LTV exceeds $1,400 with 24-month average retention (versus 6 months for general fitness apps). Gross margins run 87% after cloud compute costs.

Path to $100M ARR: 10,000 users by month 6 through assisted living partnerships. 50,000 users year 1 via Medicare Advantage pilot programs. 300,000 users year 2 as we onboard 5 major MA plans. Year 3 reaches 350,000 paying users generating $104M ARR. Our unfair advantage: Medicare Advantage plans desperately need digital solutions that actually reduce fall-related claims. We're the only app with outcome data they trust.

## Why Now?

Three convergences make this inevitable now. First, smartphone cameras reached quality thresholds for medical-grade movement analysis in 2023 - the iPhone 12 and up can track 3D skeletal positioning at 60fps with 2mm precision. Second, Medicare added reimbursement codes for "digital therapeutic exercise programs" in January 2024, creating a payment pathway that didn't exist before. Third, COVID normalized video-based healthcare for seniors - adoption of telehealth among 65+ jumped from 4% to 43% and stuck there.

Five years ago, the computer vision models didn't exist - OpenPose couldn't handle seated positions or walking aids. Today, transformer-based models achieve 98% accuracy on senior-specific movements. The cost curve is stunning: what required a $50,000 Vicon motion capture system in 2019 now runs on a $400 phone. By 2025, CMS projects 50% of Medicare Advantage plans will require digital fitness components [3].

## Competition & Moat

SilverSneakers dominates with 16 million members but offers only gym access and generic videos - no personalization, no injury prevention. Their NPS score of 42 versus our pilot's 71 shows the experience gap. Bold ($15/month, 50K users) provides live online classes but requires fixed schedules and can't see individual form. Nymbl ($30/month, 30K users) focuses solely on balance, missing strength and flexibility entirely.

Our moat is the movement dataset. We've captured 2.5 million senior exercise sessions with injury/success labels that took 18 months to collect through clinical partnerships. Competitors starting today face the cold start problem: they need data to train models but need working models to collect data. Our second advantage is distribution - our Medicare Advantage partnerships took 12 months to negotiate and include 3-year exclusivity windows. A competitor needs FDA clearance (minimum 6 months) to access these channels.

We win on speed by shipping weekly. While SilverSneakers took 3 years to add video content, we've iterated our movement detection algorithm 47 times in 6 months based on user feedback.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Top three existential risks: (1) Apple or Google release native senior fitness features - we're building on their AR/movement APIs to ensure we benefit from their improvements rather than compete. (2) Liability from exercise-related injuries - we've secured specialized insurance and included medical clearance requirements that actually strengthen our medical credibility. (3) Senior tech adoption stalls - we're designing for caregivers as purchasers/setup assistants, expanding our market to 45 million adult children.

Why hasn't Apple done this? They focus on broad population health, not medical-grade specificity. Their Fitness+ serves mainstream users; seniors need clinical-level customization they won't build. We're also moving faster - Apple Health takes years to add features while we ship meaningful improvements weekly.
