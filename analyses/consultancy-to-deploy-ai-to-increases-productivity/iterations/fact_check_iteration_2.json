        "explanation": "The analysis claims Rakuten AI costs $500/month and requires extensive training, but the source directly contradicts both claims.",
        "evidence": "Source shows pricing is 1,100 yen (~$7 USD) per month, not $500. The service is designed to be accessible without extensive training, offering prompt templates and browser-based access.",
