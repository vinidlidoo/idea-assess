# RecycleHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleHub connects manufacturers who need recycled materials with suppliers who have them. Think eBay for industrial waste - steel scraps, plastic pellets, cardboard bales. We match buyers and sellers instantly, handle logistics, and guarantee material quality through our verification network.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste 127 hours per month sourcing recycled materials through phone calls, emails, and site visits. A packaging manufacturer in Ohio told us: "I spent three weeks finding recycled PET flakes, called 47 suppliers, got 12 quotes, and still paid 30% over market rate because I had no price transparency."

The recycled materials market is a $375 billion black box. Buyers can't find reliable suppliers. Suppliers sit on inventory for months. Price discovery doesn't exist - the same ton of aluminum scrap sells for $800 in Detroit and $1,400 in Atlanta. Quality verification requires physical inspections that cost $5,000 per shipment.

Current brokers take 15-25% margins, add zero transparency, and create trust issues. 40% of transactions fail due to quality disputes. Companies are literally burning money because they can't efficiently buy or sell their waste streams.

## The Solution

RecycleHub creates instant liquidity in recycled materials. Manufacturers post what they need, our AI matches them with verified suppliers in seconds, and we handle everything from price negotiation to delivery.

Here's the magic: A plastics manufacturer needs 50 tons of HDPE pellets. They post specifications on RecycleHub. Within 60 seconds, they see five matched suppliers with real-time pricing, quality certifications, and delivery timelines. One click to order. We handle inspection, logistics, and payment. Material arrives in 72 hours instead of 3 weeks.

We're 10x better because we eliminate search time (127 hours to 10 minutes), reduce costs by 22% through price transparency, and guarantee quality through our IoT-enabled verification network. Early customers report 65% reduction in procurement time and $340,000 annual savings on material costs.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market reached $426 billion in 2024, growing at 8.3% annually [1]. In the US alone, 8,400 manufacturing facilities spend $67 billion annually on recycled inputs.

Bottom-up: 8,400 facilities × average $7.9M spend × 15% platform fee = $9.9 billion addressable market. The B2B materials marketplace sector grew 47% in 2024 as supply chain digitization accelerated. McKinsey projects 60% of industrial materials transactions will be digital by 2027 [2].

Europe's new mandatory recycled content regulations (starting 2025) will force 120,000 additional manufacturers into this market, adding $180 billion in transaction volume.

## Business Model

We charge 3-5% transaction fees based on volume, significantly below traditional broker margins of 15-25%. Suppliers pay $2,500/month for premium listings and demand analytics. Enterprise buyers pay $10,000/month for dedicated sourcing support and quality guarantees.

Unit economics: CAC of $3,200 (mostly enterprise sales), LTV of $67,000 (22-month average retention), 70% gross margins after logistics costs. At current growth, we hit $8M ARR by month 18, $100M by year 3.

The network effect is powerful - more suppliers attract more buyers, creating a liquidity flywheel. Once we have 30% of suppliers in a category, we become the default sourcing platform. This happened with steel scrap in the Midwest - we now process 67% of transactions.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this inevitable now. First, raw material costs increased 34% since 2022, forcing manufacturers to consider recycled alternatives [3]. Second, new EPA regulations require supply chain traceability for recycled content claims - impossible without digital infrastructure. Third, IoT sensors now cost $50 (vs $2,000 in 2019), enabling remote quality verification at scale.

Five years ago, manufacturers wouldn't trust online material sourcing. Today, 73% already buy virgin materials digitally. The recycled market is the last frontier. Sustainability reporting requirements (mandatory SEC climate disclosures starting 2024) force companies to track and maximize recycled content. 

The holy shit stat: China banned waste imports in 2021, leaving 127 million tons of materials searching for new markets annually [4]. This created unprecedented supply in Western markets, but no efficient distribution mechanism exists.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapMonster (2M users, $15M revenue) focuses on price reporting, not transactions. Rheaply ($20M raised) targets office furniture, not industrial materials. PACE ($8M raised) only handles plastics in Europe. Nobody provides end-to-end marketplace with quality guarantees.

Our unfair advantage: We hired the former VP of Purchasing from Dow Chemical who brings relationships with 2,000+ buyers. Our proprietary material classification system (47 patents pending) enables instant matching accuracy that competitors can't replicate. We're already the exclusive recycled materials partner for three Fortune 500 manufacturers.

Speed advantage: While competitors debate features, we're onboarding 50 suppliers weekly. By moving fast, we'll control supply in key categories before others realize the opportunity. Our two-sided network effects create compounding defensibility - after 1,000 suppliers, switching costs become prohibitive.

Competitors handle simple commodities. We're building infrastructure for complex materials with multiple quality grades, certifications, and processing requirements.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Risk 1: Large suppliers might bypass our platform after connecting with buyers. Mitigation: We hold payment in escrow and own the quality guarantee infrastructure - direct dealing means losing both.

Risk 2: Economic downturn reduces manufacturing demand. Mitigation: Recycled materials actually gain share in downturns due to cost advantages. 2008 data shows recycled material usage increased 18% while virgin materials dropped 31%.

Risk 3: Amazon or Alibaba enters this market. Our insight: B2B materials require domain expertise, quality verification, and relationship management that pure tech platforms can't provide. It's why Amazon Business hasn't disrupted industrial distribution despite 10 years of trying.

## Milestones

**90 days**: Complete first 50 transactions, exceed $2M GMV
**6 months**: Reach $500K monthly recurring revenue
**12 months**: Process $50M in transactions, close Series A at $40M valuation
