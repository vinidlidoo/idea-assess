# RecycleX: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleX connects businesses that have recyclable waste materials with companies that need raw materials for manufacturing. Think "Alibaba for trash that's actually worth money." We make it simple for a plastic bottle factory to sell their production scraps directly to a toy manufacturer who needs that exact grade of plastic.

## The Problem

Companies lose $4.5 billion annually in the U.S. alone by sending recyclable materials to landfills instead of selling them [1]. A packaging manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We pay $300/ton to dispose of our plastic trim waste, while a company 50 miles away imports the same material for $800/ton from China." 

The current recycling supply chain is broken. Businesses spend 40+ hours per month managing waste brokers who take 30-50% margins and provide zero transparency. Materials get shipped across oceans when identical supplies exist locally. Small manufacturers can't access recycled materials because minimum orders are 100+ tons. Meanwhile, 91% of plastic waste never gets recycled despite massive demand for recycled content [2]. Companies desperately need recycled materials to meet sustainability mandates - Walmart requires 20% recycled content by 2025, affecting 100,000+ suppliers.

## The Solution

RecycleX creates instant liquidity in a 15-second listing process. Upload a photo of your material, our AI identifies the grade and composition, matches it with buyers in real-time, and handles logistics through our vetted hauler network. First match happens in under 60 seconds.

We're 10x better because we eliminate middlemen completely. Direct transactions mean sellers get 40% more revenue and buyers save 25% on materials. Our computer vision system achieves 94% accuracy in material grading, eliminating the trust issues that kill most deals. Early pilot with 12 manufacturers: $2.3M in transactions, 73% repeat rate monthly, average deal closes in 4 hours versus industry standard of 2-3 weeks.

The platform works through AI-powered material identification, dynamic pricing based on 50+ market indicators, and integrated quality verification at pickup. Think StockX authentication but for industrial waste.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $51.2 billion in 2024 and grows at 7.8% CAGR [3]. U.S. B2B recycling specifically represents $18 billion annually.

Bottom-up: 300,000 U.S. manufacturers produce recyclable waste. Average company spends $120K/year on disposal. If we capture 20,000 customers (6.7%) at $6K annual platform fees, that's $120M ARR just from sellers. Buyers pay additional 3% transaction fees on $4B GMV = another $120M.

This market is exploding due to Extended Producer Responsibility laws requiring 30%+ recycled content by 2030, affecting $2 trillion in manufacturing output. China's waste import ban created a $45 billion supply gap that domestic recycling must fill.

## Business Model

We charge sellers $500/month SaaS fee plus 5% transaction success fee. Buyers access free but pay 3% on purchases. Average transaction: $15,000.

Unit economics: CAC of $2,800 (inside sales), LTV of $38,000 (24-month average retention), 73% gross margin after logistics costs. Path to $100M ARR: 1,000 customers Year 1 ($8M), 5,000 Year 2 ($42M), 12,000 Year 3 ($108M). Each customer brings 2.3 trading partners, creating network effects.

The killer metric: our GMV/customer grows 3.2x in their first year as they discover more trading opportunities. This compounds - mature customers generate 8x the revenue of new ones.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this inevitable. First, AI-powered computer vision crossed 90% accuracy for material identification in 2024 - impossible before GPT-4V and similar models [4]. Second, China's Operation National Sword banned waste imports, forcing $45 billion in materials to find new homes. Third, SEC climate disclosure rules starting 2025 require companies to report Scope 3 emissions, making recycled content critical for compliance.

Five years ago, the technology didn't exist. Five years from now, every manufacturer will trade materials this way. The inflection point: 67% of Fortune 500 companies announced recycled content commitments in 2024 alone, up from 12% in 2020 [5]. Recycled PET plastic prices jumped 340% since 2021 - the market desperately needs efficient price discovery.

## Competition & Moat

Rubicon ($2.1B valuation) focuses on waste management, not materials trading - they're Uber for garbage trucks, we're the NASDAQ for recyclables. Rheaply ($20M raised) targets office furniture, missing the $18B industrial materials market. ScrapMonster is a listings site with no transaction layer, quality verification, or logistics.

Our unfair advantage: proprietary pricing data from 50,000+ transactions creates 3x more accurate price predictions than competitors. We're building the Bloomberg Terminal for recycled materials. Network effects are massive - each new seller attracts 4.2 buyers on average, each buyer brings 1.8 sellers. After 100 transactions, switching costs hit $50K in relationship rebuilding.

We win through speed - closing our Series A four months faster than competitors lets us lock up exclusive partnerships with the top 50 manufacturers before others reach scale. Our AI lead compounds - every transaction improves our matching algorithm while competitors still manually broker deals.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Top three existential risks: (1) Commodities market crash makes recycling uneconomical - we hedge with floor pricing contracts and diversify across 12 material categories. (2) Large waste management companies build competing platforms - we're embedding deeply with ERPs to create switching costs of $200K+. (3) Regulation changes eliminate recycling mandates - unlikely given bipartisan support, but we're expanding to voluntary carbon credit generation as backup revenue.

Why hasn't Waste Management done this? They make 65% margins on landfilling - cannibalizing that for 15% marketplace margins destroys shareholder value. Classic innovator's dilemma. Plus, marketplaces require software DNA they lack - their last tech acquisition failed spectacularly, losing $400M.

## Milestones

**90 days**: 50 active traders, $1M monthly GMV, Series A term sheet
**6 months**: $5M monthly GMV, 200 customers, break-even unit economics
**12 months**: $15M monthly GMV, 1,000 customers, $8M ARR, Series B ready
