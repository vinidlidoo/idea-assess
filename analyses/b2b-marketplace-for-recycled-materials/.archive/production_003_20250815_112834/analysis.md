# ScrapHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

ScrapHub connects manufacturers who generate industrial waste with companies that need recycled materials as inputs. Think eBay for industrial byproducts - aluminum shavings from one factory become raw material for another.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies lose $4.5 billion annually on waste disposal costs while simultaneously facing 40% price volatility in virgin materials [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We pay $2,400/month to haul away HDPE scraps while our neighbor imports virgin HDPE at $1,800/ton." 

Current solutions fail because recycled material markets are fragmented across 12,000+ small brokers who operate via phone and fax. Buyers waste 15 hours/week calling brokers to find materials. Sellers get 30% less value than market rate due to limited buyer access. Quality verification happens after shipment, causing 22% rejection rates. Companies need materials within 72 hours but average broker response time is 5 days.

A metal stamping company in Detroit desperately needed 50 tons of aluminum scrap last month. After 47 phone calls over 3 days, they settled for virgin material at 3x the cost, delaying production by a week.

## The Solution

ScrapHub's magic moment: A buyer posts need for 20 tons of recycled PET, gets 5 verified quotes within 2 hours, sees quality certificates, and books shipment with one click. Materials arrive in 48 hours with blockchain-verified chain of custody.

We're 10x better because we eliminate the phone tag. Our AI matches materials based on chemical composition, not just category names. Real-time pricing data from 1,000+ transactions daily provides instant fair market value. Automated quality verification through computer vision reduces rejection rates to under 3%.

Early pilot with 12 manufacturers: 67% cost reduction in material sourcing, 8x faster transaction time, $340K in waste diverted from landfills in 60 days. Our proprietary MaterialMatch algorithm achieved 94% successful match rate versus 31% industry average.

## Market Size

Global recycled materials market: $367 billion in 2024, growing 8.3% annually [2]. U.S. B2B segment represents $89 billion opportunity.

Bottom-up: 320,000 U.S. manufacturers × $280K average annual materials spend × 10% addressable recycled portion = $8.96 billion immediate market. With 45,000 active industrial buyers on existing platforms spending average $2M/year on materials, capturing 5% market share = $4.5 billion GMV opportunity.

Market expanding due to 74% of Fortune 500 companies setting zero-waste targets by 2030. New SEC climate disclosure rules require supply chain emissions reporting starting 2025, making recycled material tracking critical.

## Business Model

We charge 3.5% transaction fee on completed deals plus $299/month SaaS fee for premium analytics. Virgin material marketplaces charge 8-12%, but our lower operational costs (no physical inventory) enable competitive pricing.

Unit economics: CAC of $1,200 (mostly inside sales), LTV of $42,000 (based on $100K average annual GMV per customer × 3.5% take rate × 12-month average retention). Gross margin of 78% after payment processing and verification costs.

Path to $100M ARR: 1,000 customers by month 12 ($3.5M ARR), 5,000 by month 24 ($35M ARR), 15,000 by month 36 ($105M ARR). Network effects kick in at 2,500 active traders when liquidity becomes self-sustaining.

## Why Now?

Five shifts make this inevitable: (1) China's 2024 recycled material import ban created $18 billion domestic supply glut needing new buyers [3]. (2) AI-powered spectroscopy can now verify material composition remotely at 1/100th previous cost. (3) 89% of manufacturers adopted digital procurement systems post-COVID. (4) Carbon border taxes starting 2026 make recycled materials 23% more valuable than virgin imports. (5) Spot polymer prices hit 10-year highs in January 2025, making recycled alternatives critical.

Materials that cost $0.12/pound to verify in 2019 now cost $0.001/pound using portable XRF scanners with cloud analysis. Holy shit stat: 67% of industrial buyers say they'd pay 15% premium for verified recycled materials with instant availability [4].

## Competition & Moat

Direct competitors: ScrapMonster ($8M revenue, 50K listings) focuses on scrap metal only, lacks quality verification. Recycler's World (15K users) is a bulletin board with no transaction capability. Rheaply raised $10M but targets office furniture, not industrial materials.

Our unfair advantage: We hired the former head of procurement from Alcoa who brings relationships with 200+ major buyers. Our MaterialMatch algorithm uses proprietary dataset from 2M historical transactions we exclusively licensed from the Institute of Scrap Recycling. First-mover advantage in blockchain custody chain creates switching costs - migrating verified history would break regulatory compliance.

Competitors miss that this isn't about listings - it's about trust. Their marketplace approach fails because industrial buyers need guaranteed quality, not more options.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Top 3 existential risks: (1) Established commodity exchanges (CME/LME) enter recycled materials - we're building exchange-grade infrastructure now to potentially partner/get acquired. (2) Quality verification fails causing major customer loss - we're implementing Lloyd's-backed insurance for all transactions. (3) Recession crushes materials demand - our variable cost model survives downturns better than inventory-heavy competitors.

Why Amazon/Alibaba hasn't done this: Industrial materials require domain expertise they lack. Their B2C logistics don't handle hazmat shipping requirements. Most importantly, relationship-based selling still matters - we augment but don't replace existing broker relationships.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Close 10 pilot customers in Midwest manufacturing corridor
**90 days**: Process $1M in GMV with <5% dispute rate
**6 months**: 500 active buyers, $5M monthly GMV
**12 months**: $40M ARR run rate, Series A metrics achieved
