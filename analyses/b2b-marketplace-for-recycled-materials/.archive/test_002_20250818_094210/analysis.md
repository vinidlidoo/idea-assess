# RecycleX: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleX connects manufacturers who need recycled materials with suppliers who have them. Think eBay for industrial waste - companies list their recyclable byproducts, buyers find exactly what they need, we handle logistics and quality verification.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $175 billion annually on virgin materials while 85% of industrial waste ends up in landfills [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We spend 3 hours daily calling 20+ suppliers to find recycled PET flakes. Half the time, quality doesn't match specs and we eat the shipping costs." 

Current recycling is broken. Buyers can't find reliable suppliers. Sellers sit on inventory for months. Quality standards vary wildly. There's no price transparency. One automotive parts manufacturer loses $2.3M yearly because they can't source enough recycled aluminum consistently - they're forced to buy virgin material at 3x the cost. Small manufacturers are completely locked out - they generate recyclables but lack the volume for direct contracts with major recyclers.

The friction is insane. Companies exchange 47 emails on average to complete one recycled material transaction. 73% of deals fall through due to quality mismatches discovered after shipping.

## The Solution

RecycleX is the first marketplace with built-in quality verification. Sellers upload material specs and photos. Our ML model (trained on 50,000 material samples) instantly grades quality with 94% accuracy. Buyers search by exact specifications - polymer type, contamination level, location, volume. Match in 30 seconds instead of 3 weeks.

The magic moment: A buyer needs 10 tons of HDPE with <2% contamination. They search, see 8 verified suppliers within 200 miles, compare prices, and book with one click. We handle logistics through our partner network. Payment releases after AI-verified delivery confirmation.

Early pilot with 12 companies: 68% reduction in procurement time, 41% cost savings versus virgin materials, 89% successful transaction rate (industry average: 31%). One metal fabricator saved $340K in first quarter. We're not incrementally better - we're eliminating entire procurement departments.

## Market Size

Global recycled materials market: $58.3 billion in 2024, growing 8.7% annually [2]. US B2B segment alone represents $18.2 billion opportunity.

Bottom-up: 47,000 US manufacturers actively buy recycled materials, spending average $1.9M annually. At $1,900 per month subscription plus 3% transaction fee, that's $2.7B addressable market just in subscription revenue. China's market is 4x larger.

The kicker: Only 9% of plastic gets recycled globally because of marketplace inefficiency [3]. Fix the marketplace, unlock 10x more supply. Extended Producer Responsibility regulations starting 2025 will force Fortune 500s to buy recycled - market will triple by 2028.

## Business Model

We charge buyers $1,900/month for unlimited access plus 3% transaction fee. Sellers list free but pay $99/month for premium features (priority listing, analytics, bulk uploads).

Unit economics are beautiful. CAC: $2,800 (inside sales). Monthly revenue per customer: $3,400 average (subscription + fees). Gross margin: 84%. Payback: 3 weeks. LTV/CAC ratio: 8.2x.

Path to $100M ARR: 2,000 active buyers by month 18 (currently 67), average transaction volume $180K/month per buyer. Network effects kick in at 500 suppliers - more inventory attracts buyers, more buyers attract suppliers. We become the pricing index for recycled materials.

## Why Now?

Three things converged in 2024: EU's Circular Economy Package mandates 65% recycling by 2025 - companies are desperate [4]. Computer vision can now identify material grade from photos with 94% accuracy (impossible until 2023). Freight marketplaces proved the model - Flexport hit $8B valuation doing this for shipping.

Five years ago, materials grading required human inspection. Too slow, too expensive. Today, our AI processes 1,000 listings daily at $0.03 each. 

Manufacturing reshoring increased US demand for recycled materials 340% since 2022 [5]. Virgin material prices hit record highs. Companies that ignored recycling now have CFOs demanding alternatives. The market inflection is happening right now - recycled aluminum trades at 72% discount to virgin, widest gap ever.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapMonster (main competitor) is a listing site - no verification, no logistics, just classified ads. $4M revenue, hasn't grown in 3 years. RecycleNet focuses on paper/cardboard only. Rubicon is waste management, not materials marketplace.

Our moat: We're building the quality standard database. Every transaction trains our AI. After 10,000 transactions, we'll have the only reliable grading system in the industry. Competitors would need years of data to catch up.

We own the supplier relationships. Signed exclusive supply agreements with 8 of the top 20 recyclers. They get premium placement, we get inventory competitors can't access. Classic marketplace defensibility - liquidity breeds liquidity.

Speed advantage: Closing enterprise customers in 3 weeks versus 6-month industry standard. Our founders sold into this exact market at Waste Management. We know every buyer personally.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Quality disputes kill marketplaces.** Mitigation: Escrow system, third-party verification for transactions over $50K, insurance partnership covering quality issues.

**Commodity price volatility.** Recycled materials swing 40% monthly. Mitigation: Optional price-lock contracts, hedging instruments for high-volume buyers.

**Big Tech entry.** Amazon Business could add this category. Mitigation: Deep industry integration, regulatory complexity, specialized logistics network they'd need years to build.

Why hasn't Waste Management built this? They make $19B yearly on collection. Efficient recycling markets would compress their margins. We're purely aligned with increasing recycling value.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 100 verified suppliers onboarded, first 10 transactions completed
**90 days**: $500K GMV, 50 active buyers  
**6 months**: $2M monthly GMV, Series A metrics achieved
**12 months**: 1,000 active buyers, $10M ARR run rate
