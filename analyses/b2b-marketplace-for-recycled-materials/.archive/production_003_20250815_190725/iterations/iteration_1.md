# CircularHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

CircularHub connects businesses that generate recyclable waste with manufacturers who need raw materials. Upload your scrap inventory, get instant pricing from verified buyers, and ship with one click. Think StockX for industrial recycling.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $450 billion annually on virgin materials while 91% of potentially recyclable industrial waste goes to landfills [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We'd love to use recycled PET, but finding reliable suppliers takes weeks of phone calls and we never know if quality matches our specs." 

Current recycling is broken. Sellers call dozens of scrap dealers hoping for fair prices. Buyers can't find materials when they need them. Quality varies wildly with no standards. Transportation costs eat margins because nobody coordinates logistics. Small batches aren't worth anyone's time. Last week, a furniture manufacturer dumped 12 tons of aluminum scrap because finding a buyer would cost more than the material was worth. Meanwhile, an auto parts maker 50 miles away imported virgin aluminum at 3x the cost.

## The Solution

CircularHub works like a commodity exchange for recycled materials. Sellers upload photos and specs of their waste streams - our AI instantly categorizes materials and suggests optimal lotting. Buyers set quality parameters and get alerts when matching inventory appears. Smart matching connects complementary waste streams - one company's plastic offcuts become another's raw material.

First-time users see value in 5 minutes. Upload inventory, get 3-5 bids within an hour, choose best price, print shipping labels. We handle payments, logistics coordination, and quality verification through our network of independent inspectors. Sellers increase recovery rates by 40% and get 25% better prices than calling random dealers. Buyers reduce material costs by 35% and procurement time from weeks to hours.

Early pilot with 12 manufacturers generated $2.3M in transactions in 8 weeks with 87% repeat usage.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $51 billion in 2024, growing 14% annually [2]. In the US alone, 45,000 manufacturing facilities generate 7.6 billion tons of recyclable waste yearly, worth $180 billion at current commodity prices. 

Bottom-up calculation: 45,000 facilities × $50K average monthly material spend × 30% addressable through marketplace = $810M immediate opportunity. As regulations tighten and ESG mandates expand, this triples by 2027. The EU's new Circular Economy Package requires 65% recycling rates by 2025, creating massive demand for efficient material recovery systems [3].

## Business Model

We charge 8% transaction fee on completed deals, split between buyer (3%) and seller (5%). At $5,000 average transaction size, we net $400 per deal. CAC of $2,800 pays back in 7 transactions (2 months based on pilot data). LTV exceeds $48,000 assuming 24-month retention at current usage rates.

Path to $100M ARR: 2,500 active facilities × $40K annual platform spend × 8% take rate. With 45,000 potential customers and 87% retention from our pilot, we need just 5.5% market penetration. Network effects kick in at 500 active users - more sellers attract buyers, creating liquidity that locks in both sides.

## Why Now?

Three things changed in 2024: China stopped accepting foreign waste, forcing domestic processing capacity to 10x. New EPA regulations require manufacturers to document recycling chains starting January 2025 [4]. AI can now identify and grade materials from photos with 94% accuracy, eliminating manual inspection bottlenecks.

Five years ago, virgin materials were cheap, regulations were lax, and matching required human expertise. In five years, every manufacturer will need verified circular supply chains for compliance. The companies building these networks today will own the $500B circular economy infrastructure of 2030. 

Recycling rates jumped from 12% to 31% in states with extended producer responsibility laws passed in 2024 [5]. Companies are scrambling for solutions.

## Competition & Moat

Rubicon ($2.1B valuation) focuses on municipal waste, not B2B manufacturing. ScrapMonster lists prices but doesn't handle transactions. Rheaply targets office furniture, not industrial materials. Traditional brokers like Sims Metal (ASX: SGM, $2.8B market cap) move slowly and take 20-30% margins.

Our advantage: proprietary material classification AI trained on 2M images from pilot customers. Exclusive contracts with 3 major logistics providers give us 40% shipping discounts others can't match. Most critically, we're building the first quality certification system for recycled materials - verified sellers get premium badges that increase sale prices 18%. Once buyers trust our quality ratings, switching costs become prohibitive.

We move 10x faster than incumbents. Rubicon took 3 years to onboard 5,000 customers. Our self-serve platform onboards 50 facilities weekly with zero human touch.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Commodity price volatility** could kill margins. We're building hedging tools and long-term contracts to guarantee price stability for 30-day periods.

**Quality fraud** could destroy trust. Every transaction over $10K gets physical inspection. Our AI detects doctored photos 97% of the time. Sellers who misrepresent materials get lifetime bans.

**Logistics complexity** at scale. Partnering with Flexport for complex international shipments. Building route optimization to bundle small loads.

If this is so good, why hasn't Waste Management done it? They make 65% margins on landfilling - a marketplace would cannibalize their core business. They're actively lobbying against circular economy mandates [6].

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 50 beta customers in Ohio/Michigan manufacturing corridor
**90 days**: Process $5M GMV with 80%+ monthly retention
**6 months**: Hit $2M monthly revenue run rate
**12 months**: $15M ARR, 500 active facilities, Series A at $100M+ valuation
