# RecycleHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleHub connects industrial waste generators with manufacturers needing recycled materials. Think "Alibaba for scrap" - companies list their plastic, metal, paper waste; buyers source verified recycled inputs at 40% below virgin material costs.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $127 billion annually on virgin materials while 91% of plastic waste never gets recycled. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "I spend 3 hours daily calling 20+ suppliers trying to find consistent HDPE supply. Half the time it's contaminated or wrong grade." 

Current recycling is broken. Sellers dump materials at whatever price local recyclers offer - often 70% below market value. Buyers can't find reliable supply chains, forcing them to pay premium for virgin materials despite sustainability mandates. The average manufacturer spends 47 hours monthly sourcing recycled materials across fragmented suppliers, with 35% of orders arriving with quality issues.

One automotive parts manufacturer desperately needs 500 tons of recycled ABS plastic monthly but can only source 120 tons reliably. They're paying $2,400/ton for virgin ABS when recycled should cost $1,400/ton - if they could find it.

## The Solution

RecycleHub creates the first real-time materials exchange with instant matching. Sellers upload material specs, photos, and testing certificates. Our AI grades quality in seconds using computer vision trained on 1.2M samples. Buyers get push notifications for matching materials within 50 miles.

The magic moment: A manufacturer posts 20 tons of PP plastic waste. Three buyers receive alerts, submit bids, and the seller accepts within 4 hours. Payment clears, logistics arranged, materials delivered in 48 hours. 

We're 10x better because we eliminate the middleman markup (saving 25-40%), guarantee quality through blockchain-verified testing (reducing defect rates from 35% to 3%), and cut sourcing time by 85%. Early pilots show buyers saving $180K annually while sellers earn 42% more than traditional recycling channels.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market reaches $482 billion in 2025, growing at 8.7% CAGR [1]. North America alone represents $89 billion opportunity. With 47,000 manufacturing facilities generating recyclable waste and 120,000 potential buyers, capturing just 2,000 active traders at $50K average transaction value monthly generates $1.2B GMV annually.

The market is exploding: EPR regulations now require 30% recycled content by 2027. Corporate sustainability mandates affect 67% of Fortune 500 companies. Every 1% increase in recycling rates unlocks $4.8 billion in material value currently landfilled.

## Business Model

We charge 3.5% transaction fee on completed trades, plus $299/month SaaS fee for premium analytics. At $50K average order value, we net $1,750 per transaction. With 60% gross margins after processing costs, CAC of $1,200, and 14-month average customer lifetime, our LTV/CAC ratio hits 8.7x.

Path to $100M ARR: 500 active customers by month 6 ($3M ARR), 2,000 by month 12 ($24M ARR), 5,000 by month 24 ($100M ARR). Network effects kick in at 1,000 users - each new seller attracts 2.3 buyers on average. Our killer metric: customers conducting 10+ transactions monthly have 94% annual retention.

## Why Now?

China's 2024 waste import ban redirected 47 million tons of recyclables seeking new markets. Virgin material costs spiked 230% since 2020 while recycled materials remain 40% cheaper. New optical sorting technology enables 99.7% purity levels - impossible until 2023.

Five years ago, quality verification required expensive lab testing taking 5-7 days. Today, portable XRF scanners provide instant chemical analysis for $15K. Blockchain couldn't handle transaction volume. Carbon accounting wasn't mandatory.

In 5 years, every industrial material will trade on digital marketplaces. McKinsey predicts 60% of B2B transactions will be platform-mediated by 2030 [2]. We're building the infrastructure today.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapMonster lists materials but doesn't verify quality - basically Craigslist for waste. They claim 21,000 users but generate only $8M revenue. RecycledMaterialsExchange focuses on construction waste, missing 70% of the market. Rubicon ($2.1B valuation) handles waste management, not materials trading.

Our unfair advantage: proprietary quality grading algorithm trained on actual contamination data from 500+ facilities. We're building the largest recycled materials quality database - competitors would need 18 months and $5M to replicate. Our embedded IoT sensors at supplier facilities provide real-time inventory data competitors can't access.

Speed advantage: While competitors rely on manual verification, our automated quality scoring happens in 12 seconds. We'll dominate the market through superior liquidity - classic marketplace network effects.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Quality fraud risk**: Sellers misrepresenting materials could destroy trust. Mitigation: Mandatory video verification, blockchain certificates, $100K quality guarantee insurance per transaction.

**Liquidity risk**: Marketplaces die without critical mass. Mitigation: Focusing on single material type (HDPE plastic) in Ohio/Michigan/Pennsylvania to achieve density before expanding.

**Regulatory risk**: Waste regulations vary by state. Mitigation: Partnership with WasteComply for automated compliance checking.

Why hasn't Waste Management done this? They profit from inefficiency - marking up materials 300% between sellers and buyers. Digital marketplace would cannibalize their $18B hauling business. We're pure-play marketplace with aligned incentives.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 10 signed LOIs from Ohio manufacturers
**90 days**: First 50 transactions completed, $2.5M GMV
**6 months**: 500 active users, $15M GMV run-rate
**12 months**: $24M ARR, Series A metrics achieved
