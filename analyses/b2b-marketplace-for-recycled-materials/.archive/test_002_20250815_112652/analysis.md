# ReCircle: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

ReCircle is a digital marketplace connecting industrial sellers of recycled materials with manufacturers who need them. Think eBay for scrap metal, recycled plastics, and reclaimed wood - but with quality verification, logistics, and financing built in.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste 127 hours per month sourcing recycled materials through phone calls, emails, and site visits. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "I spent three weeks finding 50 tons of recycled PET, calling 47 suppliers, only to discover the material was contaminated." Companies lose $2.3M annually from production delays caused by unreliable recycled material supply chains.

Current recycled material sourcing is broken: suppliers list materials on static websites with outdated inventory, buyers can't verify quality without physical inspection, pricing varies 40% for identical materials based on relationships, and logistics coordination takes 5-7 days to arrange. A furniture manufacturer recently shut down production for 8 days because their reclaimed wood supplier's inventory spreadsheet was three weeks old - costing them $450,000 in lost revenue.

The "hair on fire" moment: Tesla's Gigafactory needed 500 tons of recycled aluminum within 72 hours. They had to deploy 12 procurement staff making calls for 48 straight hours.

## The Solution

ReCircle creates the magic moment when a buyer finds exactly the recycled material they need in 3 clicks, with guaranteed quality and delivery in 48 hours. Our platform shows real-time inventory from 2,000+ verified suppliers with standardized quality grades, instant pricing, and integrated logistics.

Here's why we're 10x better: Traditional sourcing takes 127 hours; we cut it to 30 minutes. Where phone negotiations yield 40% price variance, our transparent marketplace reduces it to 5%. Physical quality inspection taking 3-5 days becomes instant with our AI-powered spectroscopy verification at supplier warehouses.

Early validation proves it works: Our pilot with 50 manufacturers reduced sourcing time by 76%, cut material costs by 18%, and eliminated 94% of quality disputes. Ford's purchasing manager said: "ReCircle saved us $3.2M in six months just on recycled steel sourcing."

The platform uses computer vision to grade materials at supplier sites, matches buyers with suppliers using ML-optimized search, handles payments with 30-day net terms, and coordinates logistics through our network of 500+ carriers specializing in recycled materials.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market reached $463B in 2024, growing at 8.3% annually [1]. Our bottom-up calculation: 45,000 US manufacturers spending average $2.8M annually on recycled materials equals $126B addressable market in the US alone.

This market is exploding due to regulatory pressure: The EU's Circular Economy Action Plan requires 55% recycled content by 2030, driving demand up 23% year-over-year. Corporate sustainability mandates mean Fortune 500 companies must source $78B in recycled materials by 2026, up from $31B today.

We don't need fairy tale market share. Capturing just 2% of US B2B recycled material transactions would generate $2.5B in GMV.

## Business Model

We charge 3.5% transaction fee on completed deals, significantly below the 8-15% margins traditional brokers take. For transactions over $100K, we add a $500 quality verification fee. Premium subscriptions at $5,000/month provide unlimited verified supplier access and priority logistics.

Unit economics work: Customer acquisition cost is $2,800 through targeted LinkedIn and trade show campaigns. Average customer lifetime value reaches $67,000 with 24-month retention. Gross margins hit 73% after logistics partnerships. At current growth, we reach $8M ARR by month 18.

Path to $100M ARR: 1,000 active buyers with $250K average annual volume at 3.5% take rate equals $8.75M. Add 10,000 buyers by year 3, average volume grows to $400K with premium features, hitting $140M ARR. Network effects compound - each supplier attracts 3.7 buyers on average.

## Why Now?

Five years ago, this was impossible: recycled material quality standards didn't exist, making digital transactions risky. IoT sensors for real-time inventory weren't deployed. Manufacturers viewed recycled materials as inferior. Logistics networks couldn't handle irregular recycled material shapes efficiently.

Today everything changed: ISO 14855 standards for recycled materials launched in 2023, enabling standardized digital trading. Portable spectroscopy devices now cost $5,000 versus $100,000 in 2019. Carbon accounting regulations force manufacturers to track and increase recycled content. Amazon's logistics network opening to third parties cut shipping costs 40%.

In 2025, 67% of manufacturers must report recycled material usage under SEC climate rules [2]. China's National Sword policy redirected 45M tons of recyclables to domestic processors, tripling US supply. The holy shit statistic: Recycled material price volatility decreased 61% in 2024 due to better supply chain visibility, making long-term contracts finally viable.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapMonster lists 500K materials but remains a classifieds site with no transactions, verification, or logistics. They process $2B GMV but take no commission. RecycleMatch raised $5M and handles $500M in waste streams but focuses on waste-to-landfill, not material-to-manufacturer. Rubicon ($2.1B valuation) owns the waste management space but ignores the recycled materials manufacturing supply chain entirely.

Our unfair advantage: We're the only platform with real-time quality verification through our network of 200 on-site spectrometers at major suppliers. Our founding team includes the former head of Ford's circular economy initiative and the architect of Flexport's freight matching algorithm.

Defensibility comes from three sources: Network effects (more suppliers attract more buyers, creating liquidity), switching costs (integrated ERP connections take 3 months to implement), and data advantage (18 months of pricing data trains our recommendation engine). Speed matters - we're onboarding 100 suppliers weekly while competitors add 20.

Honestly, ScrapMonster could add transactions tomorrow. But they're a lifestyle business making $10M annually with 12 employees - they won't risk their cash cow. Rubicon could expand here but they're focused on their IPO and won't dilute their waste management story.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Existential risk 1: Suppliers bypass our platform after initial connection. Mitigation: We handle quality disputes, provide net-30 financing, and reduce prices 18% through our bulk shipping rates - keeping both sides sticky.

Existential risk 2: Economic downturn crushes manufacturing demand. Mitigation: Recycled materials actually gain share in downturns due to 40% cost advantage over virgin materials. 2009 data shows recycled aluminum demand grew 12% while virgin fell 30%.

Existential risk 3: Amazon or Alibaba enters this market. Mitigation: B2B recycled materials require specialized quality knowledge, regulatory compliance, and relationship management they've never shown interest in. Plus, 70% of transactions happen on net terms, not credit cards.

Why hasn't Grainger done this? They tried in 2019 and shut down after 8 months. B2B recycled materials have 90-day sales cycles, 15% return rates, and require technical expertise Grainger's MRO model can't support. Our team spent 10 years learning these nuances at Ford and Waste Management.
