  "iteration_recommendation": "reject",
  "iteration_reason": "Analysis has 3 critical issues that must be addressed: (1) 10x improvement needs quantitative proof from pilot results, (2) competitive moat explanation lacks technical depth and defensibility details, (3) platform bypass risk requires stronger mitigation strategy. Additionally, 4 important improvements would significantly strengthen the narrative. The foundation is strong but these gaps would undermine credibility with sophisticated investors."
