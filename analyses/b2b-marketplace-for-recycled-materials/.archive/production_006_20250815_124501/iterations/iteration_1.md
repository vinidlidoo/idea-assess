# RecycleHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleHub connects manufacturers who need recycled materials with suppliers who have them. Think "Alibaba for recycled plastics, metals, and paper." Companies post what they have or need, we match them instantly, handle logistics, and guarantee quality through our verification network.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $120 billion annually on virgin materials while 85% of recyclable industrial waste goes to landfills [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "I spent 3 weeks calling 47 suppliers to find 10 tons of recycled PET. Half ghosted me, others couldn't guarantee purity." 

Current recycled material sourcing is broken: suppliers list on random websites, buyers rely on word-of-mouth, quality varies wildly, and logistics are a nightmare. The average procurement manager spends 31 hours per month just searching for recycled materials [2]. Meanwhile, suppliers sit on inventory for 4-6 months because they can't find buyers efficiently. One recycling center in Texas has $2.3M in aluminum sitting idle because "we don't know who needs it when."

This isn't a nice-to-have. Companies face increasing ESG mandates requiring 30% recycled content by 2025, with fines up to $50K/day for non-compliance [3].

## The Solution

Buyers post requirements (material type, grade, quantity, location) and get matched with verified suppliers in under 60 seconds. Our ML model analyzes 50+ quality parameters from supplier history to predict material grade accuracy with 94% precision. 

First magic moment: A packaging company needed 50 tons of recycled HDPE. Old way: 3 weeks of calls, 5 site visits, $8K in travel costs. With RecycleHub: 4 qualified suppliers matched in 2 minutes, samples shipped same day, deal closed in 72 hours at 18% below virgin material cost.

We're 10x better because we've built the first real-time inventory system for recycled materials. Suppliers update availability via API, IoT sensors at recycling facilities track material flows, and our quality verification network (127 labs across North America) ensures consistency. Average time from search to delivery: 5 days vs. industry standard of 35 days.

Early validation: 23 pilot customers processing $4.2M in monthly transactions, 87% repeat purchase rate within 60 days.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $57.2 billion in 2024, growing at 8.3% CAGR [4]. North America alone represents $18.6 billion opportunity. 

Bottom-up calculation: 47,000 manufacturers in the US need recycled materials × average $1.2M annual spend × 15% platform fee = $8.46 billion addressable market. 

The market is exploding due to regulatory pressure: EU's Circular Economy Package mandates 65% recycling by 2025, California's SB-54 requires 30% recycled content, and 73% of Fortune 500 companies have announced net-zero commitments requiring recycled material usage [5]. Recycled material demand will outstrip supply by 42% by 2027.

## Business Model

We charge 4-7% transaction fee based on volume (virgin material brokers charge 15-20%). For orders over $100K, we drop to 2.5% plus $500 verification fee. Premium tier ($5K/month) includes unlimited quality verifications, priority matching, and dedicated account management.

Unit economics: CAC of $2,800 (mostly enterprise sales), LTV of $47,000 (24-month average retention), 73% gross margin after logistics partnerships. Current run rate suggests $2.3M MRR by month 6.

Path to $100M ARR: 850 active enterprise accounts × $10K monthly spend × 5% take rate. We're at 23 accounts after 3 months, adding 8-12 per month. Network effects kick in at 200 suppliers - buyers attract more suppliers, creating liquidity flywheel.

## Why Now?

Three inflection points converged in 2024: (1) ESG regulations shifted from voluntary to mandatory with real penalties, (2) virgin material costs hit 10-year highs making recycled materials 20-40% cheaper, (3) AI/ML can finally solve the quality prediction problem that killed previous marketplaces.

Five years ago impossible because: No digital infrastructure at recycling facilities, quality testing took 2 weeks and cost $5K, regulations were suggestions not requirements.

Five years from now obvious because: Every manufacturer will need verified recycled content for compliance, virgin materials will be carbon-taxed into obsolescence, and closed-loop manufacturing will be standard.

Holy shit stat: 67% of manufacturers surveyed in January 2025 said they'll face production halts without reliable recycled material sources within 18 months [6].

## Competition & Moat

**ScrapLink** ($8M funding, 10K users): Focuses on metals only, no quality verification, basically Craigslist with better UI. Loses enterprise deals due to trust issues.

**WasteLoop** ($15M funding, $5M ARR): Solid tech but focuses on post-consumer waste. Average transaction $8K vs. our $47K. They're stuck in SMB land.

**Rheaply** ($20M funding): Asset reuse not materials. Different buyer persona, longer sales cycles, lower frequency.

Our unfair advantages: (1) Exclusive partnerships with 3 of the 5 largest recycling facilities giving us 31% of North American supply, (2) Patent-pending quality prediction algorithm trained on 2.3M historical transactions, (3) Only platform with real-time inventory tracking via IoT integration.

Speed advantage: While competitors debate features, we're shipping daily. Launched dynamic pricing in week 8, quality insurance in week 12. Moving faster than regulated industries expect.

BigCo threat is real - Waste Management or Republic Services could build this. But they make 65% margin on landfills. Cannibalization risk means they'll acquire not build. We're positioning for that exit.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Supplier quality fraud**: Bad actors could tank platform trust. Mitigation: Mandatory lab verification for first 5 transactions, $2M insurance policy per transaction, supplier bonds, blockchain tracking for chain of custody.

**Regulatory changes**: Policies could shift, reducing urgency. Mitigation: Operating in 3 countries to diversify regulatory risk, building features for voluntary programs, partnering with policy makers as the data provider.

**Economic downturn**: Manufacturing slows, demand drops. Mitigation: Subscription revenue provides base, downturn actually increases recycled material demand due to cost savings, building financial products for inventory financing.

Why Google hasn't done this: Unsexy industry, requires boots-on-ground at recycling facilities, regulatory complexity they avoid.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Close 10 new enterprise accounts, $500K GMV
**90 days**: Launch quality insurance product, 50 suppliers onboarded, $2M GMV
**6 months**: $100M annualized GMV, Series A metrics achieved
**12 months**: 500+ active accounts, $15M ARR, profitable unit economics
