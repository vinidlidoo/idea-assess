# RecycleX: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleX connects manufacturers who need recycled materials with suppliers who have them. Think "Alibaba for recycled plastics, metals, and paper" - we match buyers and sellers instantly, handle quality verification, and manage logistics. Companies save 40% on raw material costs while hitting sustainability targets.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $127 billion annually on virgin materials when cheaper recycled alternatives exist nearby. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We spent $3.2M on virgin PET last year while a recycler 50 miles away was landfilling the exact grade we needed because they couldn't find buyers."

The current system is broken: buyers make 50+ phone calls to find materials, quality varies wildly between suppliers, pricing is opaque, and logistics are a nightmare. One automotive parts supplier spends 120 hours monthly just sourcing recycled aluminum - that's 3 full-time employees doing nothing but making calls and sending emails.

Companies are desperate. EU regulations now require 30% recycled content by 2030. US manufacturers face similar pressures. Yet 68% of recyclable industrial materials still go to landfills because the market is too fragmented to function efficiently.

## The Solution

RecycleX users log in, specify exactly what recycled material they need (grade, quantity, location), and see real-time availability from verified suppliers within seconds. Our AI matches buyers with the optimal suppliers based on quality specs, price, distance, and reliability scores.

Here's the magic: A packaging company needing 50 tons of recycled HDPE plastic gets instant quotes from 8 pre-verified suppliers, compares quality certificates, and books delivery - all in under 10 minutes. What took 3 days now takes 10 minutes.

We're 10x better because we've digitized trust. Every batch comes with blockchain-verified quality certificates, real-time contamination testing data, and performance guarantees. Early pilots show 73% cost reduction in procurement time, 40% savings on material costs, and 100% traceability for ESG reporting.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $47.6 billion in 2024 and grows at 7.2% annually [1]. In the US alone, 14,000 manufacturers spend $18 billion yearly on recycled inputs, with average transaction sizes of $125,000.

Bottom-up: 14,000 potential customers × $1.3M average annual spend × 3% take rate = $546M annual GMV opportunity in US manufacturing alone. Add construction, packaging, and automotive sectors: $2.1B addressable market.

The market is exploding: 87% of Fortune 500 companies now have mandatory recycled content targets. New regulations in 2024 require supply chain transparency. Companies that don't hit targets face average fines of $4.3M annually.

## Business Model

We charge 3% commission on transactions plus $599/month for premium analytics. Average customer processes $1.3M in materials annually, generating $39,000 in transaction fees plus $7,200 in SaaS revenue = $46,200 annual revenue per customer.

Unit economics are stellar: CAC is $3,200 (inside sales), LTV exceeds $185,000 (4-year average retention), giving us 58:1 LTV/CAC ratio. Gross margins run 87% since we're a marketplace - no inventory, just software and verification services.

Path to $100M ARR: 500 customers by Year 1 ($23M), 1,200 by Year 2 ($55M), 2,200 by Year 3 ($101M). Network effects kick in at 1,000 suppliers - each new supplier attracts 3.7 buyers on average.

## Why Now?

Three massive shifts happened in 2024: First, China banned plastic waste imports, forcing US recyclers to find domestic buyers urgently. Second, SEC's new climate disclosure rules require detailed recycling data from public companies. Third, AI can now identify material grades from photos with 97% accuracy - impossible until 2023.

Five years ago, blockchain was too expensive for supply chain tracking ($50 per transaction). Today it's $0.02. Computer vision couldn't distinguish between PET and HDPE plastics. Manual quality testing took days. Now instant verification is possible and affordable.

In five years, this market will be completely digital. McKinsey predicts 80% of B2B materials transactions will be platform-mediated by 2029 [2]. We're capturing the transition happening right now.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapMonster (200K users, $8M revenue) focuses on metals only and lacks quality verification. Recycle1 ($5M raised) targets consumers, not B2B. Rubicon ($2B valuation) handles waste management but doesn't connect buyers and sellers directly.

Our unfair advantage: We hired the former head of sustainability from Dow Chemical who brings relationships with 400+ major buyers. Our proprietary AI model trained on 2M material samples identifies contamination 5x better than competitors. We're also the only platform with real-time pricing data from 10,000+ transactions.

Network effects create our moat: more suppliers attract more buyers, creating liquidity competitors can't match. Switching costs are high - customers integrate our API with their ERP systems. Once we have critical mass in a material category, we become the default market maker.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Incumbents like Waste Management enter our space.** Mitigation: We're signing exclusive 3-year contracts with top suppliers now. By the time they react, we'll have network effects.

**Risk 2: Quality issues damage trust.** Mitigation: $10M insurance policy per transaction, plus escrow system where payment releases only after quality confirmation.

**Risk 3: Recession reduces demand for materials.** Mitigation: Recycled materials actually gain share in downturns (30% cheaper than virgin). 2008 data shows recycled materials grew 12% while virgin materials fell 24%.

Why hasn't Amazon done this? They tried in 2019 with "Amazon Industrial" but failed because B2B materials require deep industry expertise and trust that pure tech companies lack.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 10 pilot customers from existing network
**90 days**: Process $1M in GMV with 90+ NPS score
**6 months**: 100 active buyers, $5M monthly GMV
**12 months**: $20M ARR run rate, Series A metrics achieved
