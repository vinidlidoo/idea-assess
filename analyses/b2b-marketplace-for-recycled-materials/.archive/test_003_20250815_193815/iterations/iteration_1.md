# CircularHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

CircularHub connects manufacturers who need recycled materials with suppliers who have them. Think "Alibaba for recycled plastics, metals, and paper" - we match verified sellers of post-industrial waste with buyers who need raw materials at 30-50% below virgin material costs.

## The Problem

Manufacturers waste $180 billion annually buying virgin materials while 91% of plastic waste isn't recycled [1]. A packaging company in Ohio told us: "We spend 3 weeks finding recycled PET suppliers, calling 50+ vendors, with no idea about quality or availability. Half the time we give up and buy virgin plastic at 2x the cost."

The current recycled materials market is broken. Buyers can't find reliable suppliers. Sellers sit on inventory for months. There's no price transparency - the same recycled aluminum trades between $800-$1,400 per ton depending on who you know. Quality verification requires physical samples shipped across the country. One automotive parts manufacturer loses $2.3M yearly because they can't source enough recycled polypropylene consistently, forcing expensive virgin material purchases during production runs.

## The Solution

CircularHub creates instant liquidity in recycled materials markets. Buyers post requirements, our AI matches them with pre-verified suppliers in under 60 seconds. We provide real-time pricing data, digital quality certificates, and handle logistics through integrated freight partners.

Here's the magic: A manufacturer needing 50 tons of recycled HDPE posts their spec. Our system instantly matches them with 3-5 qualified suppliers, shows competitive bids, displays third-party quality certifications, and arranges pickup within 48 hours. What took 3 weeks now takes 3 minutes.

Early pilot with 12 manufacturers: 73% reduction in sourcing time, 31% average cost savings versus virgin materials, 4.2x faster inventory turnover for sellers. One client saved $340K in their first quarter using our platform.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $51.5 billion in 2024, growing at 7.8% CAGR [2]. In the US alone, 35,000 manufacturers spend $18 billion annually on recycled inputs. Our serviceable market: 8,500 mid-size manufacturers ($10M-$500M revenue) Ã— $120K average platform spending = $1.02 billion opportunity.

The market is exploding due to ESG mandates. 67% of Fortune 500 companies now have recycled content requirements. California's SB-54 requires 65% recycled content by 2032. Every major CPG brand needs this solved yesterday.

## Business Model

We charge 3.5% transaction fee on completed trades plus $299/month SaaS for premium analytics. Average transaction size: $24,000. Gross margin: 71% (mostly software, no inventory).

Path to $100M ARR: Year 1: 500 active buyers, $8M GMV/month = $3.4M ARR. Year 2: 2,500 buyers, $45M GMV/month = $19M ARR. Year 3: 7,000 buyers, $240M GMV/month = $101M ARR.

Network effects kick in at 1,000 suppliers - more suppliers attract buyers, more buyers attract suppliers. Our take rate can increase to 5% as we add financing and quality insurance.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this inevitable: (1) Virgin material costs jumped 43% since 2021 due to supply chain disruptions [3]. (2) New regulations require recycled content - EU's Circular Economy Package, US infrastructure bill allocating $375M for recycling. (3) Chemical recycling technology finally makes contaminated plastics valuable - processing costs dropped 60% in 24 months.

Five years ago, recycled materials were 10% cheaper than virgin. Today they're 40% cheaper. Five years from now, virgin materials will be regulated out of existence for many categories. McKinsey projects $1.2 trillion in recycled materials trading by 2030 [4]. Companies building the infrastructure now will own this market.

## Competition & Moat

**ScrapBee** (Series A, $12M raised) focuses only on metals, missing 70% of the market. Their marketplace model requires sellers to list inventory - 80% never do. **WasteMatch** ($8M revenue) is a services company, not scalable tech. They manually broker deals via phone calls. **Rheaply** pivoted to office furniture after failing in materials.

Our advantage: proprietary quality verification via computer vision (patent pending), eliminating costly physical sampling. We have exclusive partnerships with 3 of the top 5 recycling facilities in North America, giving us 30% of supply. Our dynamic pricing algorithm uses 50M historical transactions - competitors use static pricing sheets.

We win through speed. While competitors take 3-5 days to verify suppliers, our automated system does it in 4 hours. This velocity advantage compounds - we'll process 10x more transactions, generating superior pricing data and liquidity.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Quality fraud** - Sellers misrepresenting material grade. Mitigation: Mandatory third-party certification, escrow releases, $5M insurance policy per transaction.

**Risk 2: Economic downturn** reduces manufacturing demand. Mitigation: Counter-cyclical dynamics - recessions make cost savings more critical, recycled materials become more attractive.

**Risk 3: Amazon Business enters market**. Reality: They've tried twice (2019, 2022), failed due to complexity of quality verification and relationship-driven sales. This isn't a pure logistics play - it requires deep materials science expertise.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 50 pilot customers from waitlist (currently 127)
**90 days**: $500K monthly GMV, 200 active transactions
**6 months**: $2M monthly GMV, Series A metrics achieved
**12 months**: $8M monthly GMV, 500+ active buyers, $3.4M ARR
