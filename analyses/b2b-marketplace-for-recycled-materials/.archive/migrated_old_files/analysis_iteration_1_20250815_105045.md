# RecycleX: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleX is a digital marketplace connecting industrial waste producers with manufacturers who need recycled materials. Think "Alibaba for scrap" - sellers post available materials with real-time pricing, buyers find verified suppliers instantly. We handle quality verification, logistics coordination, and payment processing.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $62 billion annually on virgin materials while 87% of industrial recyclables end up in landfills [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We spend 3 weeks finding reliable recycled PET suppliers, then another 2 weeks verifying quality. Half the time, the material arrives contaminated."

Current solutions fail spectacularly. Brokers take 15-30% margins while adding zero transparency. Direct sourcing requires 50+ phone calls to find one reliable supplier. Quality varies wildly - one bad batch can shut down production for days, costing $100K+ in downtime.

Companies desperately need recycled materials to meet sustainability mandates (68% of Fortune 500 have net-zero commitments by 2030), but the friction is crushing. Small manufacturers can't access supply chains dominated by relationships and regional brokers.

## The Solution

Buyers log in, search "recycled aluminum 6061," and see 47 verified suppliers with real-time availability, third-party quality certifications, and delivered pricing. One click requests samples. Our ML model predicts material quality from supplier history with 94% accuracy.

This is 10x better because we eliminate the entire discovery phase. What takes 3 weeks becomes 3 hours. We've standardized quality grades across 200+ material types, making recycled materials as easy to buy as virgin stock.

Early pilot with 12 manufacturers: 73% reduction in sourcing time, 31% cost savings versus virgin materials, 100% quality guarantee through our inspection network. Ford's Tier-2 supplier reduced material costs by $2.3M annually using our platform.

The magic: aggregated supply creates predictable availability. Our algorithm matches future waste streams to manufacturing demand, enabling 6-month forward contracts previously impossible in recycled markets.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market reached $486 billion in 2024, growing at 9.2% CAGR [2]. North America alone represents $89 billion. With 320,000 U.S. manufacturers and average recycled material spend of $1.8M annually, that's $576 billion in addressable transactions.

Bottom-up: 50,000 mid-size manufacturers Ã— $50K platform fees = $2.5B opportunity just in transaction fees. Add logistics (20% take rate on $12B shipping) = $2.4B. Quality verification services at $5K/month per enterprise customer = $600M.

Manufacturing reshoring is accelerating this explosion - U.S. manufacturing construction spending hit record $194 billion in 2024 [3]. Every new factory needs sustainable supply chains from day one.

## Business Model

We charge 3-5% transaction fees on gross merchandise value, undercutting traditional brokers by 75%. Enterprise buyers pay $10K-50K annually for unlimited sourcing, analytics, and quality guarantees. Suppliers list free but pay for premium features (featured listings, demand forecasting).

Unit economics: CAC of $2,800 through targeted LinkedIn outreach. LTV of $47,000 (16-month payback). Gross margins at 74% since we're asset-light. At $10M GMV/month, we net $400K in transaction fees plus $250K in SaaS revenue.

Path to $100M ARR: 1,000 enterprise accounts ($50K average) = $50M. Transaction fees on $2B GMV = $60M. We need just 0.4% market share. Network effects kick in at 5,000 suppliers - buyers attract sellers attract buyers.

## Why Now?

Three seismic shifts converged in 2024: EU's Carbon Border Tax went live, affecting $74 billion in U.S. exports [4]. California's SB-54 requires 65% recycled content by 2032. Virgin polymer prices spiked 47% while recycled stayed flat, creating unprecedented arbitrage.

Five years ago, recycled materials lacked standardization - every batch was unique. Now, NIR spectroscopy enables instant composition analysis for under $50K. API-first logistics platforms (project44, FourKites) finally make spot shipping viable for irregular materials.

In 2019, only 12% of manufacturers had sustainability mandates. Today it's 73% and boards are firing CEOs who miss targets [5]. The $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Act includes $350M specifically for recycling infrastructure, legitimizing the entire sector.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapMonster lists materials but doesn't handle transactions (just lead-gen). Recycleye focuses on AI sorting, not marketplace. Rheaply targets office furniture, not industrial materials. Circ acquired for $140M but only does textiles.

Our unfair advantage: we're building the quality verification network competitors can't replicate. 47 inspection partners across North America, all using our standardized protocols. Competitors list materials; we guarantee them.

Switching costs compound - once buyers integrate our API for procurement workflows, ripping it out means retraining teams and losing historical pricing data. Our supply prediction algorithm improves 3% monthly as transaction data accumulates.

Speed wins here. Every supplier exclusive we sign blocks competitors from that inventory. We're moving 3x faster than ScrapMonster (they shipped 2 features in 2024; we ship 2 weekly).

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Commodity price volatility** could crater demand overnight. Mitigation: forward contracts and hedging products that lock in margins regardless of spot prices.

**Quality fraud** could destroy trust. Mitigation: blockchain-verified chain of custody plus mandatory insurance on all transactions over $50K. One bad actor can't kill the network.

**Large incumbents** (Waste Management, Republic Services) could build competing platforms. Reality: they make 67% margins on landfilling - cannibalization prevents them from pushing recycling. We're their partner, not competitor, handling the demand they can't monetize.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 10 beta customers with $500K in letters of intent
**90 days**: Process $1M GMV with 50+ successful transactions
**6 months**: Reach $5M monthly GMV, secure Series A term sheet
**12 months**: $15M GMV/month, 500 enterprise customers, expand to Mexico
