# ReCircle: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

ReCircle connects manufacturers needing recycled materials with verified suppliers through an automated marketplace. Think "Alibaba for recycled plastics, metals, and paper" with real-time pricing, quality verification, and logistics coordination built in.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste 47 hours monthly sourcing recycled materials through phone calls, emails, and spreadsheets. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "I spent three weeks finding recycled PET that met our specs, only to have the supplier fail quality checks after delivery." Companies lose $180,000 annually from rejected shipments, delayed production, and price volatility.

Current brokers charge 15-25% margins while providing zero transparency. Suppliers sit on $2.3M average inventory because they can't efficiently match with buyers. The fragmented market means 68% of recyclable industrial materials end up in landfills despite manufacturer demand. One automotive parts maker desperately needs 500 tons of recycled aluminum monthly but can only source 200 tons reliably through existing channels.

## The Solution

Buyers post material requirements and receive matched, pre-verified suppliers within 4 hours. Our platform shows real-time pricing from multiple suppliers, third-party quality certifications, and books logistics with one click. First transaction typically happens within 48 hours of signup versus 3-4 weeks traditionally.

We're 10x better because we eliminate middlemen, provide instant price discovery, and guarantee quality through escrow and inspection partnerships. Early pilot with three manufacturers saved them 31% on material costs and reduced sourcing time by 85%. The platform uses ML to predict pricing trends and automatically matches supply/demand based on location, specifications, and historical performance. Buyers save $420,000 annually while suppliers increase inventory turnover by 3.2x.

## Market Size

Global recycled materials market reaches $342B in 2024, growing 9.3% annually [1]. US B2B segment alone represents $67B opportunity. Bottom-up: 42,000 US manufacturers × $1.6M average recycled material spend × 15% platform fee = $10B addressable market.

Manufacturing reshoring and EPR regulations are accelerating adoption. Recycled material usage in manufacturing will double by 2030 as carbon taxes make virgin materials prohibitively expensive [2]. The market inflection is happening now - venture funding in circular economy platforms increased 340% in 2024.

## Business Model

We charge 3.5% transaction fee to buyers, 1.5% to suppliers. Average transaction size is $47,000, generating $2,350 gross profit per transaction. Current CAC is $2,800 with 18-month LTV of $42,000, yielding 15:1 LTV/CAC ratio.

Path to $100M ARR: 10 customers at $50K monthly = $6M ARR (Year 1), 100 customers = $60M ARR (Year 2), 200 customers = $120M ARR (Year 3). Network effects kick in at 50 suppliers per category - buyers attract suppliers attract more buyers. At scale, we become the pricing index for recycled materials, similar to LME for virgin metals.

## Why Now?

Extended Producer Responsibility laws in 12 states now require 30%+ recycled content by 2025 [3]. Virgin plastic prices increased 78% since 2022 while recycled plastic pricing remains stable. Spot market digitization finally reached critical mass - 67% of manufacturers now source materials online versus 12% in 2019.

Five years ago, quality verification required physical inspection. Now, blockchain-verified chain of custody and portable spectrometers enable instant remote verification. Manufacturing couldn't hit recycled content mandates without digital sourcing infrastructure. In five years, buying recycled materials through phone calls will seem as archaic as faxing purchase orders.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapLink (Series A, $8M raised) focuses only on metals with $3M GMV. RecycleMatch operates as bulletin board without transactions, payments, or verification. Rubicon ($2B valuation) targets waste management, not material trading. Traditional brokers like ISRI members lack technology and transparency.

Our advantage: proprietary quality verification network with 200+ certified inspectors, exclusive partnerships with three major recyclers controlling 30% of US PET supply, and only platform with integrated logistics covering 48 states. We move 10x faster with weekly product releases while competitors update quarterly. Network effects strengthen as we aggregate supply/demand data competitors can't access. ScrapLink charges 8% fees and requires manual quality checks; we're automated at 5% total fees.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Supplier fraud**: Escrow payments, mandatory inspections, $5M insurance policy per transaction. Track record system penalizes bad actors automatically. **Commodity price crashes**: Platform fee model insulates us from price volatility; we profit from volume not margins. **Amazon/Alibaba entry**: Deep industry relationships and specialized quality requirements create 18-month minimum catch-up period.

Why hasn't Alibaba done this? Recycled materials require local sourcing (shipping costs kill margins beyond 500 miles), specialized quality knowledge, and regulatory compliance expertise they lack.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 10 beta suppliers, 3 enterprise buyers
**90 days**: $500K GMV, 50 verified suppliers  
**6 months**: $5M monthly GMV, Series A metrics
**12 months**: $15M monthly GMV, 500+ active buyers
