# RecycleX: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleX connects manufacturers who need recycled materials with suppliers who have them. Think "Alibaba for recycled plastics, metals, and paper" - companies post what materials they have or need, we match them instantly and handle logistics.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste 47 hours per month sourcing recycled materials through phone calls, emails, and site visits. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "I spent three weeks trying to find 50 tons of recycled PET. Finally found it 2,000 miles away at 3x the price because I had no other options."

The recycled materials market is completely fragmented. There are 18,000 recycling facilities in the US alone, but no centralized way to find who has what. Companies are literally calling dozens of recyclers asking "do you have recycled HDPE?" Meanwhile, recyclers sit on $4.2 billion of unsold inventory because buyers can't find them. One recycler reported destroying 200 tons of perfectly good recycled plastic last year because storage costs exceeded potential profits.

Current brokers take 15-30% margins and provide zero transparency. Companies have no idea about material quality until trucks arrive at their loading dock. 35% of shipments get rejected for quality issues, costing manufacturers $50,000 per rejected load in delays and reshipping.

## The Solution

Here's the magic moment: A manufacturer needs 100 tons of recycled aluminum. They post the request on RecycleX. Within 4 hours, they have 12 verified suppliers bidding, can see quality certifications, real-time pricing, and available quantities. They select a supplier, and we handle quality verification, logistics, and payment. What took 47 hours now takes 47 minutes.

We're 10x better because we aggregate real-time inventory from thousands of suppliers into one searchable database. Our ML model predicts material quality from supplier history and testing data with 94% accuracy. This eliminates the trust problem that kills most deals.

Early validation: We ran a 3-month pilot with 50 manufacturers and 200 suppliers. Average time to source materials dropped from 12 days to 1.5 days. Transaction values increased 3.2x because buyers found better matches. One automotive parts manufacturer saved $2.1M annually just from better price discovery.

How it works: Suppliers upload inventory via API or our mobile app. Our system standardizes specifications across 50+ material types. Buyers search by material type, quality grade, location, and quantity. Smart matching algorithm considers logistics costs, quality requirements, and supplier reliability. All transactions include escrow and quality guarantees.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $312 billion in 2024, growing at 7.8% annually [1]. The US B2B portion represents $67 billion. Bottom-up: 50,000 US manufacturers regularly buy recycled materials, spending average $1.3M annually. At $500/month SaaS + 2% transaction fees, that's $300M subscription revenue plus $1.3B in transaction fees annually.

The market is exploding due to new regulations. The EU's Circular Economy Package requires 50% recycled content in plastics by 2025. Similar US regulations are coming - California already requires 30% recycled plastic in bottles. McKinsey projects the recycled materials market will hit $500B by 2030 as regulations expand globally [2].

## Business Model

We charge suppliers $500-2,000/month for unlimited listings based on inventory volume. Buyers pay 2% transaction fee on completed purchases. At scale, a typical supplier pays us $18,000/year ($1,500/month subscription + transaction fees). Buyers generate $26,000/year average from transaction fees.

Unit economics: CAC is $2,800 (mostly enterprise sales). LTV is $92,000 (4-year average retention at $23,000/year). Gross margins are 78% since we're primarily software with some verification costs. 

Path to $100M ARR: Year 1: 500 suppliers, 2,000 buyers = $12M ARR. Year 2: 2,000 suppliers, 10,000 buyers = $48M ARR. Year 3: 5,000 suppliers, 30,000 buyers = $120M ARR. Network effects kick in after 1,000 suppliers - each new supplier attracts 5 buyers, each buyer attracts 2 suppliers.

## Why Now?

Three things changed in 2024: First, recycled material prices hit parity with virgin materials for the first time. Recycled PET now costs $1,200/ton versus $1,250/ton for virgin - the economics finally work. Second, AI can now reliably assess material quality from photos and specifications - impossible until GPT-4V. Third, new SEC rules require companies to report recycled content percentages starting 2025, creating massive demand.

Five years ago, recycled materials cost 40% more than virgin materials - no economic incentive existed. Material quality verification required expensive physical testing. In five years, regulations will make recycled content mandatory - every manufacturer will need this.

2024 saw $4.3 billion invested in circular economy startups, up 340% from 2023 [3]. Coca-Cola just announced they'll use 50% recycled plastic by 2026. Tesla started buying recycled aluminum at scale. The shift is happening right now.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapLink (raised $45M) focuses only on metals, has 3,000 suppliers but no quality verification - 40% of their transactions fail. WasteMatch ($12M raised) does general waste, not specialized in recyclables, only 500 active users. Rheaply ($10M raised) targets internal corporate reuse, not external B2B marketplace.

Our unfair advantage: We have exclusive data partnerships with the three largest testing labs (Intertek, SGS, Bureau Veritas) giving us quality histories on 70% of US recyclers. Our founding team includes the former head of sustainability at Dow Chemical (brings 200 enterprise customers) and the CEO of Alabama's largest recycling facility (brings 500 supplier relationships).

Network effects create defensibility - more suppliers attract more buyers, creating more transaction data, improving our matching algorithm, attracting more users. After 5,000 suppliers, switching costs become prohibitive as buyers rely on our quality ratings. We're moving 10x faster than competitors - launching 5 material categories monthly versus their 1.

ScrapLink is strong in metals but can't expand to plastics/paper due to their tech stack. WasteMatch has good corporate relationships but their marketplace is too general to handle material specifications properly.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Top 3 risks: First, large materials distributors like Waste Management could build competing marketplace. Mitigation: We're partnering with them as channel partners, giving them preferred rates. They make more money working with us than competing. Second, quality verification at scale. Mitigation: Computer vision AI plus partnership with testing labs. We're also building network of independent inspectors. Third, adoption in conservative industry. Mitigation: Start with tech-forward companies (automakers, electronics) who pull suppliers onto platform.

Why hasn't Alibaba done this? They tried in 2019 and failed - recycled materials require specialized quality knowledge they lack. Their generalist marketplace can't handle 50+ grades of recycled plastic, contamination specifications, and regional quality variations.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 50 suppliers onboarded, first 10 transactions completed
