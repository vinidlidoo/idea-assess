# RecycleHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleHub is a digital marketplace that connects businesses selling recycled materials directly with manufacturers who need them. Think "Alibaba for recycled plastics, metals, and paper" - we make buying recycled materials as easy as ordering office supplies online.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste 47 hours per month sourcing recycled materials through phone calls, emails, and site visits to multiple suppliers. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "I spent three weeks trying to find 50 tons of recycled PET flakes last month. Called 23 suppliers, got 14 different prices, and still wasn't sure about quality." 

The recycled materials market is incredibly fragmented - 85% of suppliers are small operations with less than $5M revenue, making discovery nearly impossible. Buyers face unpredictable pricing (fluctuations of 40-60% monthly), inconsistent quality standards, and zero transparency on availability. Meanwhile, recycling facilities sit on $2.3B worth of materials they can't move efficiently because they lack access to buyers. This inefficiency adds 30% to material costs and results in 2.7 million tons of recyclable materials going to landfill annually simply because suppliers and buyers couldn't connect in time.

## The Solution

When a manufacturer needs recycled materials, they log into RecycleHub and see real-time inventory from 500+ verified suppliers in one place. They filter by material grade, location, and certification, then receive instant quotes with locked-in pricing for 48 hours. Our "Material Match Score" uses computer vision to verify quality against uploaded samples, eliminating the trust issue.

This is 10x better because buyers go from 47 hours to 47 minutes finding materials. We've aggregated fragmented supply into a single searchable database with standardized grading. Early pilots show 34% cost reduction and 89% faster procurement cycles. 

The platform works through API integration with supplier inventory systems and IoT sensors at recycling facilities for real-time availability. Payments, logistics, and quality verification happen within the platform. In pilot testing, Dow Chemical reduced recycled material sourcing time by 91% and found three new suppliers they didn't know existed.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market reached $58.2B in 2024 and grows at 7.8% annually [1]. In the US alone, 12,000 manufacturers purchase recycled materials, spending average $4.8M annually. This creates a $57.6B addressable market just domestically.

Bottom-up: 12,000 manufacturers Ã— $48,000 platform fees (1% transaction fee on $4.8M) = $576M direct revenue opportunity. Adding logistics (3% take rate) and financing services pushes this to $1.7B.

Digital procurement in materials markets grew 47% in 2024 as supply chain digitization accelerated. The EU's new circular economy regulations requiring 35% recycled content by 2027 will force every manufacturer to find reliable recycled material sources.

## Business Model

We charge buyers 1% transaction fee and suppliers $299/month for enhanced listings. Average transaction size is $47,000, generating $470 per transaction. With current pilots averaging 8 transactions monthly per buyer, that's $3,760 monthly revenue per active buyer.

CAC is $2,100 (mainly enterprise sales), but LTV exceeds $142,000 (3-year average customer lifespan). Gross margins are 84% since we're a pure marketplace. At 1,000 active buyers (8.3% market share), we hit $45M ARR. At 2,500 buyers, we reach $113M ARR.

The network effect is powerful - more suppliers attract more buyers, creating better price discovery, which attracts more suppliers. Once we have critical mass in a material category, we become the default sourcing platform.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this inevitable now. First, materials traceability technology finally works - blockchain-based chain-of-custody tracking became commercially viable in 2024 at $0.12 per ton. Second, China's recycling import ban (fully enforced January 2024) forced Western manufacturers to find domestic suppliers urgently. Third, corporate sustainability mandates now require verified recycled content - 73% of Fortune 500s have binding recycled material targets for 2025.

Five years ago, IoT sensors for real-time inventory cost $5,000+ per facility. Today they're $400. API-based inventory management didn't exist in recycling facilities. Now 67% have digital systems. In 2019, only 12% of recycled material transactions happened online. By Q3 2024, it reached 41% and accelerating.

The tipping point: January 2025 SEC climate disclosure rules require supply chain emissions reporting, making recycled material tracking mandatory.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapMonster ($8M revenue) focuses only on metals and lacks real-time inventory. RecycleMatch (acquired by NexGen for $31M) operates as a bulletin board without transaction capability. Rubicon ($1.2B valuation) targets waste management, not materials trading. Each misses the critical piece: real-time, verified inventory with embedded transactions.

Our unfair advantage is the proprietary Material Match Score algorithm trained on 2.7M material samples - competitors would need three years to replicate this dataset. We've also secured exclusive partnerships with the top 5 recycling equipment manufacturers, giving us automatic integration with 34% of US recycling facilities.

Moving fast, we'll achieve liquidity in plastics and metals before competitors react. Our two-sided network effect creates switching costs - buyers won't leave their established supplier relationships and transaction history. The 18-month enterprise sales cycle in this industry means competitors starting now won't close meaningful deals until mid-2026.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

First, adoption risk - manufacturers resist change. Mitigation: We're embedding with equipment manufacturers to become the default option on new recycling systems. Offering net-60 payment terms eliminates procurement friction.

Second, quality verification at scale. Mitigation: Partnership with SGS (world's largest testing company) provides physical verification within 24 hours nationwide. Our computer vision system correctly identifies material grade 94% of the time, improving with each transaction.

Third, economic downturn reduces material demand. Mitigation: Recycled materials actually gain share during recessions due to cost advantages. In 2008, recycled material usage increased 18% while virgin materials dropped 31%.

Why hasn't Alibaba done this? They tried in 2019 but failed because recycled materials require local presence for quality verification and logistics complexity they couldn't handle remotely.
