# RecycleHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleHub is a digital marketplace connecting industrial waste producers with manufacturers who need recycled materials. Think "Alibaba for recycled plastics, metals, and paper" - we match sellers who have waste materials with buyers who can use them as raw inputs for production.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $500 billion annually on virgin materials while 75% of industrial waste ends up in landfills [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We spend 3 weeks finding reliable recycled PET suppliers, make 50+ phone calls, and still pay 40% more than necessary because we can't compare prices." Current recycling is broken because it relies on fragmented regional brokers, opaque pricing, and zero quality standards. Small manufacturers can't find consistent supply, while waste producers can't find buyers beyond local recyclers offering pennies on the dollar. One automotive parts manufacturer lost $180,000 last quarter because their recycled aluminum supplier disappeared mid-contract with no alternative source available.

## The Solution

RecycleHub creates instant liquidity in the recycled materials market through real-time matching and standardized quality metrics. Sellers list materials with our proprietary grading system (photos analyzed by computer vision), buyers see all available inventory within 500 miles with transparent pricing, and we handle logistics through integrated freight partners. The magic moment: a manufacturer needing 50 tons of recycled HDPE plastic finds 8 verified suppliers in 60 seconds versus 3 weeks of phone calls. We're 10x better because we aggregate fragmented supply, standardize quality ratings, and guarantee transactions through escrow. Early pilot with 12 companies: average transaction time dropped from 21 days to 3 days, procurement costs fell 35%, and suppliers increased revenue 2.8x by accessing more buyers.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $385 billion in 2024, growing at 8.2% CAGR [2]. Bottom-up: 400,000 manufacturers in North America spending average $2.3M on raw materials annually, with 30% actively seeking recycled alternatives = $276B addressable market. Just capturing plastics and metals represents $95B opportunity. The EU's new mandatory recycled content regulations (30% by 2030) and similar US legislation pending will triple demand in 36 months [3]. Major corporations like Unilever and P&G have committed $65B to recycled materials procurement by 2027, but can't find supply at scale.

## Business Model

We charge 6-8% transaction fee on completed deals, split between buyer (2%) and seller (4-6% based on volume). Average transaction size: $45,000. Unit economics: CAC of $1,200 through digital marketing, LTV of $28,000 (customers transact 8x/year, 24-month retention). Gross margins at 85% since we're pure marketplace. Path to $100M ARR: 10,000 active buyers × $250K annual purchases × 7% take rate. Network effects kick in at 1,000 suppliers - more supply attracts buyers, more buyers attract suppliers. At scale, we become the pricing index for recycled materials globally.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this inevitable: (1) Virgin material costs increased 45% since 2021 due to supply chain disruption [4], making recycled materials economically competitive for the first time. (2) Computer vision can now grade material quality at 94% accuracy, eliminating the trust barrier that killed previous marketplaces. (3) New SEC climate disclosure rules require companies to report supply chain emissions starting January 2025, driving massive demand for documented recycled content. Five years ago, recycled materials were 50% more expensive than virgin, quality verification required physical inspection, and no regulatory pressure existed. In five years, every manufacturer will source 40%+ recycled materials by law.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapMonster (2M users, ~$15M revenue) focuses on scrap metal only and operates as a listing site without transactions. Recycle1 raised $8M but remains regional (Southeast only) with 500 active users. Rheaply ($20M raised) targets office furniture, not industrial materials. They miss the mark by lacking quality standardization, transaction guarantees, and integrated logistics. Our unfair advantage: we're building the first quality grading AI trained on 50,000+ material samples, creating the industry standard others must follow. Defensibility comes from two-sided network effects, switching costs from integrated ERP systems, and exclusive supplier agreements with the top 100 waste producers. We'll win through blitzscaling - capturing 20% of suppliers in 18 months before competitors react. ScrapMonster is strong in metals but can't expand to plastics/paper without rebuilding their entire platform.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Top risks: (1) Chicken-and-egg marketplace problem - we're solving through focusing on one material type (PET plastic) in one region (Midwest) first, achieving liquidity before expanding. (2) Large waste management companies (Waste Management, Republic Services) could build competing platforms - but they're incentivized to keep prices opaque and have failed at digital innovation for a decade. (3) Quality disputes could destroy trust - our escrow system and third-party inspection network (partnering with SGS) protects both sides. If this is so good, why hasn't Waste Management done it? They make 65% gross margins on current opaque pricing and have zero incentive to create transparency.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 50 suppliers onboarded, $500K GMV
**90 days**: First $1M monthly GMV, 200 active users
**6 months**: $5M monthly GMV, Series A metrics achieved
**12 months**: 1,000 suppliers, $15M monthly GMV, expand to 3 material categories
