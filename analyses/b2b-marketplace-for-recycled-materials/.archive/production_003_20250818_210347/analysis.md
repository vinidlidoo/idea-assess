# RecycleHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleHub is a digital marketplace connecting manufacturers who need recycled materials with verified suppliers of post-industrial and post-consumer waste. Think "Alibaba for recycled materials" - companies buy and sell plastic pellets, metal scrap, recycled paper, and glass cullet through our platform with guaranteed quality specs and transparent pricing.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste 47 hours per month sourcing recycled materials through phone calls, emails, and unreliable brokers [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "I spent three weeks finding recycled PET that met our specs, only to receive contaminated material that ruined a $50,000 production run." 

Current recycled material trading is broken. Buyers can't verify quality before purchase, leading to 23% rejection rates and $2.1 billion in annual losses from contaminated materials [2]. Suppliers sit on $8 billion of inventory they can't move because they lack visibility to buyers. The fragmented market means pricing varies by 40% for identical materials depending on who you know. Small manufacturers pay 35% premiums because they lack the volume to negotiate directly with large recyclers.

## The Solution

RecycleHub transforms material sourcing from weeks to minutes. Buyers post their exact specifications - polymer type, contamination limits, volume needed, delivery date. Our AI matches them with pre-verified suppliers in seconds, not weeks. Every supplier undergoes third-party quality certification, with material samples tested by our partner labs.

The magic moment: A manufacturer needs 50 tons of recycled HDPE pellets. They post specs at 9 AM. By 9:15 AM, they have five quotes from verified suppliers with lab-certified quality reports. They select a supplier, and materials arrive with a quality guarantee. Time saved: 46 hours. Cost reduced: 22%. Contamination issues: zero. Our pilot customers report 85% reduction in sourcing time and 31% cost savings on recycled materials.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $457 billion in 2024, growing at 8.3% annually [3]. North America alone represents $89 billion, with 42,000 manufacturers actively purchasing recycled materials. 

Bottom-up: 12,000 mid-size manufacturers × $3.2M average annual recycled material spend × 3% platform fee = $1.15 billion opportunity in the US alone. The market is exploding due to new regulations - 27 states now mandate minimum recycled content in packaging, creating $31 billion in forced demand by 2027 [4]. Corporate ESG commitments have doubled recycled material premiums since 2022.

## Business Model

We charge 3% transaction fees on completed trades, averaging $2,400 per transaction. Suppliers pay $500/month for premium listings and analytics. Enterprise buyers pay $5,000/month for unlimited RFQs and dedicated support.

Unit economics: CAC of $1,200 (mostly trade show acquisition), LTV of $38,000 (32-month average retention), 71% gross margins after payment processing. Path to $100M ARR: 1,000 active buyers × 10 transactions/month × $2,400 average fee = $28.8M transaction revenue, plus 2,000 premium suppliers × $500/month = $12M SaaS revenue, plus 200 enterprise accounts × $5,000/month = $12M enterprise revenue. Total: $52.8M ARR by year 2, doubling to $105M by year 3 through geographic expansion.

## Why Now?

Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws passed in 2024 require manufacturers to use 30% recycled content by 2025 or face massive fines [5]. This created overnight demand for $47 billion in recycled materials that doesn't exist in accessible form today.

Five years ago, recycled material quality was too inconsistent for widespread adoption. Today, new optical sorting technology has improved purity from 87% to 99.3%, making recycled materials viable for premium applications. The cost curve flipped in 2023 - recycled PET now costs 18% less than virgin plastic due to oil price increases. Meanwhile, Gen AI enables instant material matching across complex specifications - impossible with traditional databases. China's 2024 waste import ban redirected 45 million tons of materials seeking new buyers.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapHub ($8M revenue) focuses only on metal scrap, missing 73% of the market. WastePlace (4,000 users) operates as a bulletin board without quality verification - their 31% transaction failure rate drives users to us. Rubicon ($600M valuation) targets waste management, not material trading - different business entirely.

Our unfair advantage: We've partnered with SGS and Bureau Veritas for exclusive quality certification, giving us the only platform with lab-verified materials. Our proprietary MaterialMatch AI, trained on 2.3 million historical transactions, achieves 94% successful match rates versus 61% industry standard. Network effects kick in fast - every new supplier increases value for buyers and vice versa. Switching costs are high once companies integrate our API for automated procurement. We're already processing $12M in monthly GMV after 8 months, while competitors took 3 years to reach $5M.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Commodity price volatility** could reduce transaction volumes. We're building price hedging tools and long-term contracts to provide stability. **Quality fraud** could destroy trust - we escrow payments until delivery confirmation and maintain $10M insurance policy for quality guarantees. **Alibaba or Amazon Business entry** is our biggest threat - but recycled materials require specialized quality verification they lack. Their generalist approach failed in metals (Amazon Business shut down their metals marketplace in 2023) [6].

If this is so good, why hasn't Alibaba done it? They tried and failed - their Recycled Materials category launched in 2022 and shut down in 2024 due to quality issues and regulatory complexity.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 10 enterprise buyers for pilot program
**90 days**: Process $5M in monthly GMV  
**6 months**: Achieve $2M ARR from transaction fees
**12 months**: 500 active buyers, $15M monthly GMV, ready for Series A
