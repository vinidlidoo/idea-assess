# RecycleX: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleX connects manufacturers who need recycled materials with suppliers who have them. Think eBay for industrial waste - aluminum scrap, plastic pellets, recycled paper. We handle discovery, quality verification, logistics, and payment in one platform.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $120 billion annually on virgin materials while 85% of industrial waste goes to landfills [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "I spent 3 weeks calling 47 suppliers to find 10 tons of recycled PET. Half never called back, the rest couldn't guarantee quality."

Current procurement involves endless phone calls, email chains, and site visits. Buyers can't find reliable suppliers. Suppliers sit on inventory for months. Quality varies wildly - one bad batch can shut down a production line for days. There's no standardization, no price transparency, no trust.

A packaging company lost a $2M contract because they couldn't source recycled content fast enough to meet their client's ESG requirements. This happens every day.

## The Solution

Buyers post what they need. Our AI matches them with verified suppliers in seconds, not weeks. Every supplier gets quality-certified through our network of 200+ independent inspectors. Smart contracts handle payments - suppliers get paid in 3 days, not 90.

The magic moment: A buyer needs 50 tons of recycled aluminum. They post specs at 9am. By noon, they have 5 verified quotes with guaranteed quality scores, delivered pricing, and one-click ordering. What took 3 weeks now takes 3 hours.

Early pilot with 12 manufacturers: 73% reduction in procurement time, 31% cost savings versus virgin materials, 100% quality guarantee success rate. One customer went from 20% recycled content to 65% in 4 months.

## Market Size

Global recycled materials market: $461 billion in 2024, growing 8.1% annually [2]. B2B segment represents $180 billion. North America alone: 45,000 manufacturers spending $67 billion on recycled materials.

Bottom-up: 15,000 high-volume buyers × $4.5M average annual spend × 15% platform fee = $10.1 billion addressable market. The market doubles by 2030 as regulations mandate recycled content - California's SB-54 requires 65% recycled plastic by 2032 [3].

## Business Model

We charge 3-5% transaction fee based on volume. Suppliers pay $500/month for premium listing and analytics. Enterprise buyers pay $5,000/month for unlimited RFQs and dedicated support.

Unit economics: $2,800 CAC, $67,000 LTV, 71% gross margin. Average transaction: $45,000. At 2,500 transactions/month, we hit $67.5M GMV and $3.4M monthly revenue. Path to $100M ARR: 8,000 active buyers doing 2 transactions/month at $52,000 average.

Network effects kick in at 500 suppliers - more suppliers attract buyers, more buyers attract suppliers.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this inevitable:

1. Regulations exploded: 37 states passed recycled content mandates in 2024 [4]. EU's Circular Economy Package requires 55% recycled packaging by 2030. Companies face $100K+/day fines for non-compliance.

2. Carbon accounting software (Persefoni, Watershed) now tracks Scope 3 emissions. Every Fortune 500 needs recycled materials data for ESG reports. We're the data layer.

3. Logistics costs dropped 40% since 2022. AI-powered quality inspection costs 1/10th of human inspectors. What required $50M infrastructure in 2019 now needs $5M.

Virgin material prices increased 47% since 2021 while recycled materials stayed flat - the economic case finally works.

## Competition & Moat

**Rubicon** ($2.1B valuation): Focuses on waste management, not materials trading. No quality verification. 2% of their revenue from marketplace.

**ScrapMonster**: Listings site with 50K users. No transactions, no logistics, no quality control. Basically Craigslist for scrap.

**Excess Materials Exchange** (Netherlands): €8M revenue, EU-only, focuses on construction. Can't handle cross-border complexity.

Our moat: We own the quality verification network. 200+ certified inspectors across North America, growing 50/month. Competitors would need 18 months and $20M to replicate. Our proprietary grading algorithm (17 material parameters) becomes industry standard - everyone will have to use our scores.

We're 10x faster because we control the entire stack: discovery, verification, logistics, payment. Others are features, we're the platform.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Quality failures**: One contaminated batch destroys trust. Mitigation: $10M insurance policy per transaction, 3-stage inspection, blockchain quality tracking. 99.7% quality success rate in pilots.

**Commodity price swings**: Recycled materials can drop 50% overnight. Mitigation: Dynamic pricing updated hourly, hedging partnerships with commodity traders, focus on specialty materials with stable pricing.

**Amazon/Alibaba entry**: They have distribution but lack domain expertise. Mitigation: Lock in enterprise contracts (3-year terms), build proprietary quality standards, acquire key suppliers. By the time they notice us, we'll have 70% market share.

If this is so good, why hasn't Waste Management done it? They make $20B/year hauling trash. A marketplace cannibalizes their core business.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 50 verified suppliers onboarded, LOIs from 10 enterprise buyers
**90 days**: $1M GMV, 500 successful transactions
**6 months**: $5M monthly GMV, Series A metrics hit
**12 months**: 1,000 active buyers, $15M monthly GMV, $30M Series A closed
