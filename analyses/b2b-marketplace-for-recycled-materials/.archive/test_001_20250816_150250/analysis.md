# RecycleHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleHub connects businesses that generate waste materials with manufacturers who need recycled inputs. Think "Alibaba for recycled plastics, metals, and paper" - we match sellers of industrial waste with buyers who turn it into new products, handling logistics and quality verification.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $62 billion annually buying virgin materials while 91% of plastic waste never gets recycled [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We'd save $400K yearly using recycled PET, but finding reliable suppliers takes 40+ hours per month of calling around." 

Current recycling is broken because suppliers and buyers can't find each other efficiently. Small manufacturers email dozens of recycling centers hoping someone has the right grade of material. Recyclers sit on inventory because they don't know who needs it. Quality varies wildly with no standardization. Transportation costs kill deals when parties finally connect.

The CEO of a Michigan auto parts manufacturer described their "hair on fire" moment: "We lost a $2M contract because we couldn't source 50 tons of recycled ABS plastic in time. The material existed 200 miles away, but we had no way to know."

## The Solution

RecycleHub creates instant liquidity in recycled materials. Buyers post needs (e.g., "500 tons recycled HDPE, Grade A, delivered to Detroit by March 1"), and our algorithm matches them with verified suppliers within seconds. First-time users typically find materials 85% faster and 30% cheaper than traditional sourcing.

The magic moment happens when a manufacturer realizes they can source recycled materials as reliably as virgin ones. Our platform provides real-time pricing, standardized quality grades, integrated logistics, and payment protection. Early pilots with 12 manufacturers showed average savings of $180K annually and 72% reduction in sourcing time.

We've already facilitated $2.3M in transactions during our 6-month pilot, with 89% of users making repeat purchases within 60 days.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $57.2 billion in 2024, growing at 8.4% annually [2]. Our bottom-up calculation: 140,000 US manufacturers × $85K average annual recycled material spend × 15% platform fee = $1.78 billion addressable market.

Just in plastics recycling, the market is exploding from $45 billion today to projected $72 billion by 2028 [3]. New regulations requiring 30% recycled content in packaging by 2030 are forcing every CPG company to scramble for materials.

## Business Model

We charge 7-12% transaction fees (vs. 20-35% traditional broker margins), with sellers paying 4% and buyers 3-8% depending on volume. Our unit economics: $850 average CAC, $42K LTV, 68% gross margins after logistics partnerships.

Path to $100M ARR: 2,500 active buyers × $340K average annual GMV × 12% take rate. We're already at 147 active users doing $390K monthly GMV after 6 months. At current growth (23% MoM), we hit $100M ARR in 24 months. Network effects kick in at ~500 suppliers - more supply attracts buyers, creating a liquidity flywheel.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this inevitable: (1) Virgin material prices spiked 47% since 2021, making recycled materials economically superior [4]. (2) New EPA regulations require 30% recycled content by 2030, creating $12 billion in forced demand. (3) AI-powered material matching became accurate enough (94%+) only in 2024 to handle complex specifications.

Five years ago, recycled materials were 20% more expensive than virgin. Today they're 15% cheaper. In 2019, only 12% of manufacturers used recycled inputs; today it's 43% and accelerating [5]. The holy shit stat: Corporate recycling commitments totaling $4.2 trillion were announced in 2024 alone - 3x all previous years combined.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapHub ($8M Series A) focuses only on metals with 20K tons monthly volume - we already surpass them in plastics. WasteConnect (acquired for $65M) handles municipal waste, not B2B manufacturing materials. RecycleBank tried this in 2019 but failed due to manual matching - our AI handles 50x more SKUs automatically.

Our unfair advantage: proprietary quality verification network. We've partnered with 200+ testing facilities for instant material certification - competitors would need 18+ months to replicate. Plus, we're building the industry's first recycled materials price index, becoming the default market reference (like Platts for oil).

Network effects compound: more suppliers improve match rates, attracting buyers, which brings more suppliers. After hitting critical mass in plastics (our beachhead), expansion to metals/paper uses the same infrastructure at zero marginal cost.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Quality consistency**: Recycled materials vary wildly. Mitigation: Escrow payments released only after third-party verification; $2M insurance policy per transaction.

**Logistics costs**: Transportation can exceed material value. Mitigation: Partnership with FreightHub provides 40% discounted shipping; algorithm optimizes for regional matching.

**Economic downturn**: Manufacturing slows, demand drops. Mitigation: Recycled materials become more attractive in downturns due to cost savings; we'd shift focus to higher-margin circular economy consulting.

Why hasn't Waste Management done this? They're a $70B company focused on collection, not B2B marketplaces. Their average customer generates waste; ours consumes it. Different DNA entirely.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Close 10 enterprise pilots ($5M+ annual spend each)
**90 days**: $1M monthly GMV, 500+ verified suppliers
**6 months**: $5M monthly GMV, Series A ready
**12 months**: 3 material categories, $15M ARR, 2,000 active buyers
