# CircularHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

CircularHub connects manufacturers needing recycled materials with waste processors and recyclers. Think "Alibaba for trash that's worth money." We match buyers seeking specific grades of recycled plastics, metals, paper, and textiles with verified suppliers who can deliver consistent quality at scale.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste 47 hours per month sourcing recycled materials through phone calls, emails, and site visits. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "I spent three weeks trying to find 50 tons of rPET flakes that met our specs. Found a supplier through a broker's cousin. The quality was inconsistent, we lost $120,000 in production downtime."

The recycled materials market is a $400 billion black box. Buyers can't find reliable suppliers. Suppliers sit on inventory they can't move. Price discovery is impossible - the same bale of cardboard sells for $80/ton in Texas and $180/ton in California. Quality standards don't exist. One procurement manager described it: "It's like buying diamonds with a blindfold on, except the diamonds might be glass, and the seller might disappear tomorrow."

Companies are literally burning money. Virgin materials cost 40% more than recycled equivalents, but procurement teams default to virgin because recycled sourcing is chaos.

## The Solution

CircularHub is the first platform to digitize the entire recycled materials transaction. Buyers post their exact specifications - grade, quantity, location, timeline. Our ML model matches them with pre-verified suppliers within 4 hours. Every supplier undergoes our 47-point verification including facility audits, quality testing, and financial stability checks.

Here's the magic moment: A packaging company needs 100 tons of post-consumer HDPE. They post specs at 9am. By lunch, they have five matched suppliers with locked-in prices, quality certificates, and guaranteed delivery dates. What took 47 hours now takes 4.

Early pilot with three Fortune 500 manufacturers: 73% reduction in sourcing time, 31% cost savings versus virgin materials, zero quality rejections in six months. One CPG giant is routing all $50M of annual recycled plastic purchasing through us.

We're not just listing materials - we're standardizing an entire industry. Our proprietary grading system translates between regional standards. Smart contracts handle escrow and release payment only after quality verification.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $447 billion in 2024 and grows 8.4% annually [1]. In the US alone, 72 million tons of recyclable materials worth $98 billion change hands yearly.

Bottom-up: 14,000 US manufacturers buy recycled materials regularly. Average annual spend: $7 million. At $70,000 per customer (1% transaction fee), that's $980 million in annual platform fees. Just 1,000 customers gets us to $70M ARR.

The market is exploding. New regulations require 30% recycled content by 2030. Every Fortune 500 has pledged to increase recycled material usage by 50% within five years. The EU's Circular Economy Package mandates recycled content minimums starting 2025.

## Business Model

We charge 3% commission on transactions, split between buyer (1%) and supplier (2%). Average transaction: $240,000. Average customer does 12 transactions annually. 

Customer economics: CAC of $8,000 (enterprise sales), LTV of $86,400 (3-year average retention), 85% gross margins after verification costs.

Path to $100M ARR: Year 1: 50 enterprise accounts ($4.2M), Year 2: 300 accounts ($25M), Year 3: 700 accounts ($59M), Year 4: 1,200 accounts ($101M).

Network effects kick in at 500 suppliers - more suppliers means better matches, lower prices, faster fulfillment. This attracts more buyers, which attracts more suppliers. Competitors can't replicate our supply density.

## Why Now?

Three shifts made this possible in 2024: First, manufacturers finally treat sustainability as operations, not marketing. Chief Procurement Officers now own recycling targets with real P&L impact. Second, IoT sensors and computer vision can now grade materials remotely with 94% accuracy - impossible until last year. Third, $2.1 trillion in sustainability-linked loans require companies to prove recycled content usage.

Five years ago, recycled materials were 70% more expensive than virgin. Today they're 40% cheaper. Five years from now, virgin materials will be regulated out of existence for many categories. Companies not securing recycled supply chains today won't exist in 2030.

The tipping point: January 2024, California required 50% recycled plastic in packaging. Procurement teams went from "nice-to-have" to "find recycled plastic or we can't ship product to California." That regulation goes national in 2026.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapMonster lists materials but doesn't verify quality or handle transactions - they're Craigslist, we're the NYSE. RecycleMatch (acquired 2023 for $32M) focused on waste-to-landfill, not materials-to-manufacturing. Rubicon ($2B valuation) handles waste management, not materials trading.

Our moat: the verification network. We've invested $2M building relationships with 200 testing facilities globally. A competitor would need 18 months and $5M to replicate. By then, we'll have 3,000 suppliers locked into annual contracts.

We win on speed. While competitors build consensus, we shipped. Our platform processes $10M in monthly transactions. ScrapMonster took seven years to reach that milestone. We own the enterprise segment because we speak their language: SLAs, SOC2 compliance, SAP integration.

If this was easy, Waste Management ($70B market cap) would have built it. They tried. Their "WM Recycle Finder" shut down after 18 months. They know waste, not materials. They think in trucks and landfills, we think in polymers and profit margins.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

China could resume importing recycled materials (banned since 2018), crushing US prices. Mitigation: Focus on regional markets where transport costs create natural price floors. Even with China buying, regional spreads remain 40%+.

Recession kills demand for all materials. Mitigation: Recycled materials actually gain share in downturns as companies cut costs. 2008 saw recycled content increase 23% while virgin materials dropped 40%.

Quality fraud could destroy trust. Mitigation: Blockchain tracking from source to factory, third-party verification required for all transactions over $100K, insurance policy covers quality disputes.

Why hasn't Amazon done this? They tried with "Amazon Business Recycling" in 2019. Killed it in six months. B2B materials require domain expertise Amazon lacks. You can't treat copper scrap like coffee makers.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Close five paid pilots with Fortune 1000 manufacturers
**90 days**: Process $5M in GMV with 50+ verified suppliers
**6 months**: $2M ARR run rate, Series A term sheets
**12 months**: $10M ARR, 500 enterprise accounts, expand to Europe
