# RecycleHub: B2B Marketplace for Post-Industrial Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleHub connects manufacturers with verified suppliers of recycled plastics, metals, and composites through instant pricing and quality guarantees. We're the Alibaba for recycled materials - buyers find what they need in seconds, not weeks.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste 47 days annually sourcing recycled materials through phone calls, emails, and site visits [1]. A procurement manager at Ford told us: "I spent three weeks finding recycled aluminum that met our specs, only to discover contamination issues after delivery. We lost $180,000 in production delays."

Current recycled material sourcing is broken. Buyers can't verify quality until materials arrive. Suppliers sit on $4.2 billion in unsold inventory because they can't reach buyers efficiently [2]. Price discovery requires dozens of calls - one buyer quoted receiving prices ranging from $0.45 to $1.20 per pound for identical recycled PET.

The average manufacturer rejects 31% of recycled material shipments due to contamination or specification mismatches. Each rejection costs $12,000 in logistics and delays. Companies desperately want to hit sustainability targets but can't risk production lines on unreliable materials.

## The Solution

RecycleHub digitizes the entire transaction. Suppliers upload materials with standardized testing data from our certified lab network. Our AI instantly matches materials to buyer specifications and provides binding quotes in under 60 seconds.

Here's the magic moment: A packaging manufacturer needs 50 tons of recycled HDPE. They specify color tolerance, melt flow index, and contamination limits. RecycleHub shows 8 pre-verified matches with locked-in pricing. They select, pay, and schedule delivery - total time: 4 minutes. Previously: 12 days.

We're 10x better because we guarantee quality. Every batch gets third-party tested. Our $50M insurance policy covers specification failures. Early customers report 78% reduction in procurement time and 100% elimination of quality rejections.

In our pilot with 12 buyers and 34 suppliers, we processed $8.7M in transactions with zero quality disputes. Average time from search to purchase: 6.3 hours versus industry standard of 19 days.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $46.7 billion in 2024, growing 14.3% annually [3]. By 2027, it reaches $78 billion. Our specific target - post-industrial recycled plastics and metals in North America - represents $12.8 billion today.

Bottom-up calculation: 42,000 US manufacturers spending average $1.8M annually on recycled materials = $75.6 billion total addressable market. We focus initially on the 8,500 companies spending $5M+ annually, representing $42.5 billion.

The market inflection is happening now: 87% of Fortune 500 companies committed to 30%+ recycled content by 2025 [4]. EU regulations require 25% recycled plastic in packaging by 2025. Every manufacturer needs reliable recycled material supply immediately.

## Business Model

We charge 3.5% transaction fee to buyers, 1.5% to suppliers. At $50,000 average order value, we net $2,500 per transaction. Additional revenue: $299/month SaaS for inventory management tools, $150 per quality certification.

Unit economics: CAC of $2,800 (60-day sales cycle), LTV of $47,000 (average customer transacts monthly for 24 months). Gross margin: 87%. At current growth, we hit $8M ARR by month 18.

Path to $100M ARR: 10,000 transactions monthly at $55,000 average = $550M GMV. At 4% take rate = $22M monthly = $264M ARR. We need just 2% market share of our target segment.

The network effect is brutal: more suppliers attract buyers seeking selection. More buyers attract suppliers seeking demand. After 500 active traders, the marketplace becomes self-reinforcing. Competitors can't catch up.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this inevitable: First, recycled material quality improved dramatically. New optical sorting technology (deployed 2023-2024) achieves 99.7% purity versus 94% in 2019 [5]. Materials finally meet manufacturing specifications reliably.

Second, carbon pricing changed economics. With carbon credits at $85/ton (up from $20 in 2020), using recycled materials saves manufacturers $3,200 per ton in carbon costs alone [6]. The financial incentive flipped from "nice to have" to "business critical."

Third, supply chain software adoption hit critical mass. 76% of manufacturers now use digital procurement tools, up from 23% in 2019 [7]. They're ready for digital material sourcing.

Five years ago, materials weren't pure enough, incentives weren't strong enough, and buyers weren't digital. In five years, every material transaction will be digital - the only question is which platform wins.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapRight raised $12M, has 400 suppliers, but only handles metals - missing 60% of the market. Their average transaction is $8,000; ours is $50,000 because we serve large manufacturers. Rheaply focuses on office furniture, not industrial materials. Cirplus operates in Europe with incompatible regulatory requirements.

Our unfair advantage: we're the only platform with integrated quality assurance. We partnered with SGS and Intertek (testing labs) to provide instant certification. Competitors just list materials - we guarantee them. This took 18 months to build; competitors need the same timeline to catch up.

Switching costs compound quickly. After buyers integrate our API with their ERP systems (average implementation: 3 weeks), switching requires IT resources they won't allocate. Our proprietary material classification system becomes their standard.

We win through speed: closing 50 enterprise customers before competitors recognize the opportunity. Our founder's 15 years running recycling operations gives us relationships competitors can't replicate. We know exactly which 200 companies to target first.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Suppliers might go direct to bypass fees.** Mitigation: We handle payments, logistics, and disputes - services worth more than our 1.5% fee. Plus, suppliers going direct lose access to our demand network.

**Risk 2: Economic downturn reduces manufacturing demand.** Mitigation: Recycled materials become more attractive in downturns due to 40% cost savings versus virgin materials. 2008 data shows recycled material usage increased during recession.

**Risk 3: Amazon Business or Alibaba enters our market.** They lack specialized knowledge - recycled materials require complex quality grading they can't standardize. Their generalist approach fails in technical B2B markets requiring expertise.

"Why hasn't Waste Management done this?" They're asset-heavy, focused on collection infrastructure. Marketplace software requires different DNA - zero WM executives have marketplace experience.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 25 verified suppliers with $10M+ inventory listed
**90 days**: Complete first 100 transactions, $5M+ GMV  
**6 months**: $2M ARR, 500 active traders
**12 months**: $8M ARR, Series A metrics achieved
