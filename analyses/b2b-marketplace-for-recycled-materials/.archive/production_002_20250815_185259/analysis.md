# CircularFlow: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

CircularFlow connects industrial waste producers with manufacturers who need recycled materials. Think eBay for factory scrap - manufacturers list their plastic, metal, paper waste and buyers purchase it as raw material inputs.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies generate 7.6 billion tons of industrial waste annually, with 67% ending up in landfills despite being recyclable [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We pay $18,000/month to dispose of HDPE scrap that another factory 50 miles away buys virgin for $31,000/month. We just don't know each other exist."

Current recycling brokers take 35-45% margins and require minimum volumes of 10+ tons, excluding 78% of small-to-medium manufacturers. Companies waste 120+ hours/year on disposal paperwork, compliance tracking, and finding buyers through cold calls and trade shows. The average manufacturer loses $275,000 annually on disposal costs for materials that have resale value of $180,000 - a half-million dollar swing they're missing.

## The Solution

Manufacturers upload material specs, photos, and volumes in 3 minutes. Our AI instantly matches them with verified buyers within 200 miles, showing real-time pricing based on 50,000+ completed transactions. First transaction typically happens within 72 hours versus industry average of 6-8 weeks.

We handle logistics coordination, compliance documentation, and payment processing. Early pilot with 47 manufacturers showed 82% cost reduction in waste disposal, average new revenue of $14,000/month from material sales. Our proprietary matching algorithm considers material grade, contamination levels, volume consistency, and transport costs to ensure 94% transaction success rate versus 71% industry standard.

Key metric: Users complete first profitable transaction 10x faster than traditional broker channels.

## Market Size

Global industrial recycling market reached $452 billion in 2024, growing at 8.3% CAGR [2]. US market alone represents $67 billion with 320,000 manufacturing facilities producing recyclable waste. Bottom-up: 320,000 facilities × average $85,000 annual waste value × 15% take rate = $4.1 billion addressable market.

The market is fragmenting rapidly - number of small recycling transactions (<50 tons) grew 340% from 2019-2024 as manufacturers seek cost savings. EU regulations requiring 65% recycled content by 2030 will force US manufacturers to secure recycled supply chains to maintain export eligibility.

## Business Model

We charge 8% transaction fee, split between seller (3%) and buyer (5%). At $15,000 average transaction size, we net $1,200 per deal. Current pilots show 4.2 transactions per customer per month = $5,040 monthly revenue per active user.

CAC through targeted LinkedIn/trade show marketing: $2,100. Gross margin: 67% after payment processing and insurance. LTV: $121,000 based on 24-month average retention. Path to $100M ARR: 1,650 active customers × $5,040 monthly = $99.8M. At current growth rate (47% QoQ), we hit this in 18 months.

Network effects create pricing power - more suppliers improve buyer match rates, attracting more buyers, creating liquidity that compounds value.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this inevitable: China stopped accepting recycled materials in 2021, forcing domestic processing capacity to triple [3]. Recycled material prices increased 67% since 2022 due to supply chain disruptions [4]. New EPA reporting requirements starting January 2025 require digital tracking of all industrial waste - companies need our software anyway.

Five years ago, material verification required physical inspection. Today, computer vision can identify plastic grade with 98.7% accuracy from photos. Transportation costs were prohibitive at $1.20/mile in 2019; they've dropped to $0.71/mile with freight optimization. GenZ procurement managers (now 31% of buyers) expect marketplace experiences and won't tolerate fax-based ordering.

2024 is the inflection year: recycled materials became cheaper than virgin for first time in history (24% discount average) while maintaining quality parity.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapHub raised $12M, has 8,000 users, $2.1M revenue but only handles metals - missing 73% of recyclable materials. WasteMatch (acquired 2023) peaked at $4M revenue but required enterprise contracts starting at $50K/year. RecycleBank focuses on consumer recycling, irrelevant for B2B.

Our unfair advantage: proprietary dataset of 50,000 material transactions with quality outcomes, enabling instant price discovery competitors can't match. We move 5x faster using modern stack (competitors use 10-year-old Ruby codebases). Our API-first approach captured 3 major ERP integrations in 6 months - took ScrapHub 3 years.

Defensibility comes from liquidity network effects and switching costs. Once manufacturers integrate our compliance tracking into their workflows (average 4.5 hours setup), switching requires 40+ hours of migration. Our two-sided ratings system creates trust that took eBay 10 years to build - we're doing it in 10 months.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Regulation changes**: New state laws could fragment compliance requirements. Mitigation: Building jurisdiction-agnostic compliance engine, partnering with waste management lawyers in 12 states.

**Economic downturn**: Manufacturing volumes drop 30% in recessions. Mitigation: Counter-cyclical dynamics - recycled materials become more attractive when budgets tighten. 2008 data shows recycling increased 18% during manufacturing downturn.

**Large incumbent entry**: WasteManagement or Republic Services could build competing marketplace. Reality: They make 72% margins on landfilling - marketplace would cannibalize their core business. Their average digital project takes 3 years; we'll own the market by then.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 100 manufacturers signed LOIs, 10 completed transactions
**90 days**: $500K GMV, 500 active users, Series A lead identified
**6 months**: $3M GMV run-rate, 2,000 users, 3 strategic enterprise pilots
**12 months**: $15M GMV, 10,000 users, Series A closed at $40M valuation
