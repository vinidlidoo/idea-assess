# RecycleX: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleX connects manufacturers who need recycled materials with suppliers who have them. Think eBay for industrial waste - factories sell their scrap metal, plastic, and paper directly to companies that can use it as raw material.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $218 billion annually on virgin materials while 78% of industrial waste goes to landfills [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We spend 3 weeks and $15,000 finding reliable recycled PET suppliers for each production run." 

Current recycled material sourcing is broken. Buyers make 50+ phone calls to find materials, dealing with inconsistent quality, unreliable supply, and zero price transparency. Suppliers sit on inventory for months because they can't find buyers efficiently. One aluminum recycler reported: "We had 500 tons of clean scrap sitting for 6 months while Ford's supplier was importing virgin aluminum from Canada."

The friction is insane - companies literally dump recyclable materials because finding buyers costs more than disposal fees.

## The Solution

RecycleX is a real-time marketplace where verified suppliers list materials with lab-certified quality specs, photos, and instant pricing. Buyers search by material grade, see available inventory within 500 miles, and purchase with one click.

The magic moment: A manufacturer needing 10 tons of recycled HDPE opens our app, sees 15 verified suppliers with certified material specs, compares prices, and locks in supply in 5 minutes instead of 3 weeks.

We're 10x better because we provide instant matching, quality verification through third-party labs, and guaranteed delivery dates. Early pilot with 12 manufacturers reduced procurement time by 85% and costs by 32%. Materials move in 3 days average versus industry standard of 45 days.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $423 billion in 2024, growing at 7.8% CAGR [2]. In the US alone, 45,000 manufacturers spend $89 billion annually on recyclable raw materials.

Bottom-up: 45,000 potential buyers Ã— $12,000 annual platform fee = $540M direct revenue opportunity. Add 3% transaction fees on $15B in platform GMV = $450M. Total addressable: ~$1B annually.

The market is exploding due to corporate ESG mandates - 87% of Fortune 500 companies now require recycled content minimums from suppliers [3].

## Business Model

We charge buyers $1,000/month for unlimited access plus 3% transaction fee. Suppliers list free but pay 2% on completed sales. Average transaction size is $47,000.

Unit economics: CAC of $2,800, 18-month LTV of $31,000, 68% gross margin. At 1,000 customers paying $12K annually plus transaction fees averaging $18K per customer, we hit $30M ARR. 

Path to $100M: 2,500 enterprise buyers + marketplace GMV of $2B generates $110M ARR by year 4. Network effects kick in as more suppliers attract more buyers, creating liquidity that competitors can't match.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this inevitable now:

1. **Regulation**: EU's Circular Economy Package and US Infrastructure Act require 30% recycled content by 2027 - companies face $10M+ fines for non-compliance [4]

2. **Supply chain crisis**: Virgin material costs increased 340% since 2020; recycled materials are now 45% cheaper than virgin equivalents [5]

3. **Digital transformation**: 72% of manufacturers adopted digital procurement in 2024 versus 12% in 2019

Five years ago, recycled materials were 20% more expensive than virgin, quality verification required physical visits, and manufacturers used paper-based procurement. Today, spectroscopy testing provides instant quality verification via mobile devices, making digital marketplace viable.

## Competition & Moat

**Direct competitors**: ScrapMonster ($8M raised, 50K users) focuses on metals only and lacks quality verification. Rheaply ($20M raised) targets office furniture, not industrial materials. Both use listing sites without transaction capability.

**Our unfair advantage**: We're the only platform with integrated quality verification through partnership with Bureau Veritas (testing labs). Our proprietary MaterialMatch algorithm factors in 47 variables including contamination levels, processing requirements, and logistics costs - competitors just match by material type.

**Defensibility**: Two-sided network effects strengthen with scale. Switching costs are high once buyers integrate our API with their ERP systems. We're aggregating fragmented supply faster than anyone - already 3,000 verified suppliers versus ScrapMonster's 800.

BigCos like Waste Management focus on collection, not marketplace. Their business model conflicts with enabling direct manufacturer-to-manufacturer sales.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Quality disputes** - Mitigation: Escrow payments released only after third-party verification; $5M insurance policy covers quality issues

**Risk 2: Supplier fragmentation** - Mitigation: Partner with 10 major recycling associations representing 15,000 suppliers for instant critical mass

**Risk 3: Economic downturn reduces demand** - Mitigation: Recycled materials become MORE attractive in recessions due to cost savings; 2008 data shows recycled material usage increased 23% during downturn

Why hasn't Amazon done this? Industrial materials require domain expertise in quality standards, contamination testing, and logistics that consumer marketplaces lack. Amazon tried with "Amazon Supply" and failed.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 3 Fortune 500 buyers for pilot program
**90 days**: Process $1M in transactions with 95% satisfaction rate
**6 months**: $250K MRR with 50 enterprise customers
**12 months**: $3M ARR, 70% gross margin, ready for Series A
