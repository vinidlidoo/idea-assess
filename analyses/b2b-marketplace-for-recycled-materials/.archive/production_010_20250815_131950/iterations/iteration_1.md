# RecycleX: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleX connects manufacturers who need raw materials with suppliers of high-quality recycled plastics, metals, and paper. Think "Alibaba for recycled materials" - we match buyers and sellers, verify material quality, and handle logistics to make buying recycled as easy as buying virgin materials.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste 127 hours per quarter sourcing recycled materials through fragmented suppliers, phone calls, and email chains. A packaging manufacturer told us: "I spent three weeks finding recycled PET that met our specs. We almost missed our sustainability deadline because I couldn't find verified suppliers."

Companies face brutal challenges: 67% of recycled material purchases fail quality standards on first delivery. Pricing varies by 40% between identical materials from different suppliers. There's no centralized inventory visibility - buyers call 15+ suppliers to find materials in stock. Current brokers charge 18-25% margins while adding zero transparency.

The result: Despite 78% of Fortune 500 companies having sustainability mandates requiring recycled content, only 31% hit their targets. They literally cannot find enough quality recycled materials fast enough.

## The Solution

Buyers log into RecycleX and see real-time inventory of 50,000+ SKUs of recycled materials within 500 miles. Our AI matches their specifications to verified materials in 3 seconds. They see transparent pricing, third-party quality certifications, and can order with one click.

The magic moment: A buyer who spent 3 weeks sourcing finds verified materials in 3 minutes. We're not 10% better - we're 100x faster. Our pilot with 12 manufacturers reduced sourcing time by 94% and material costs by 22%.

How it works: Suppliers upload inventory via API, we verify quality through our network of 200+ testing partners, our matching algorithm connects buyers to materials that meet their exact specifications, and we handle logistics through integrated freight partners. Buyers get materials 8x faster with quality guaranteed or money back.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $47.2 billion in 2024, growing at 8.7% annually [1]. In the US alone, 14,000 manufacturers spend $8.3 billion annually on recycled plastics, metals, and paper.

Bottom-up: 14,000 US manufacturers × average $590K annual recycled material spend × 5% transaction fee = $413M addressable market just in transaction fees. Add logistics coordination (additional 7% take rate) and quality verification services ($1,200/month SaaS fee), and we reach $1.1B TAM.

The market is exploding: New SEC climate disclosure rules mean 3,400 additional public companies must track recycled content by 2025, creating urgent demand for transparent, verified supply chains.

## Business Model

We charge buyers 5% transaction fee on successful orders (average order: $47,000). Suppliers pay $299/month for premium placement plus 2% for payment processing. Enterprise buyers pay $1,200/month for unlimited quality verifications and dedicated support.

Unit economics: CAC of $2,800 (primarily inside sales), LTV of $38,000 (16-month average retention, $2,375 monthly revenue per customer), 68% gross margins after payment processing and verification costs.

Path to $100M ARR: 300 active buyers in Year 1 ($8.5M), 1,200 in Year 2 ($34M), 3,500 in Year 3 ($99M). We need just 25% of Fortune 500 manufacturers to hit this target - we already have LOIs from 47 companies.

## Why Now?

Four shifts make this inevitable now:

First, regulatory explosion: The SEC's March 2024 climate rules require recycled content disclosure. California's SB 54 mandates 30% recycled content by 2028. The EU's Circular Economy Package requires 25% recycled plastic in bottles by 2025. Companies face millions in fines without compliance.

Second, price parity: Virgin plastic costs increased 340% since 2020. Recycled materials are now 15% cheaper than virgin for the first time in history. The economic argument finally works.

Third, technology enablement: Near-infrared spectroscopy can now verify material composition in real-time for under $100/test. Blockchain-based chain-of-custody tracking became commercially viable in 2023.

Five years ago, recycled materials cost 40% more than virgin. Today they're cheaper. In five years, virgin materials will be regulated out of existence in many categories.

## Competition & Moat

Direct competitors miss the mark:

**ScrapBee** ($4M raised, 800 suppliers) focuses only on metals, no quality verification, buyers report 45% order failure rate. **WastePlace** (200 customers, $2.1M revenue) is a bulletin board with no transaction capability or logistics integration. **Recycle1** handles only plastics, limited to California, no API integration.

Our unfair advantages: We're the only platform with integrated quality verification across all material types. Our proprietary matching algorithm (trained on 2M historical transactions) achieves 94% first-order success rate versus industry average of 55%. We've secured exclusive partnerships with the three largest testing labs in North America.

Defensibility comes from network effects - more suppliers attract more buyers, creating liquidity. Our data moat grows with each transaction, improving matching accuracy. Switching costs are high once companies integrate our API into their procurement systems.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Large distributors could add digital capabilities.** Mitigation: We're partnering with them as channel partners, offering white-label solutions that give them digital presence without development costs.

**Risk 2: Quality verification at scale.** Mitigation: We're building an automated verification network using computer vision and spectroscopy, reducing human verification needs by 80%.

**Risk 3: Economic downturn reduces material demand.** Mitigation: Recycled materials actually gain share in downturns as companies seek cost savings. 2008 data shows recycled material usage increased 12% while virgin dropped 23%.

Why hasn't Amazon done this? They tried with Amazon Business but failed because recycled materials require deep industry expertise, quality verification infrastructure, and relationships with highly fragmented suppliers who distrust Big Tech.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 10 pilot customers from LOI list, complete 50 test transactions
**90 days**: Achieve $500K GMV, 95% quality success rate
**6 months**: $2M monthly GMV, 150 active buyers, Series A ready
**12 months**: $8M monthly GMV, 300 active buyers, $8.5M ARR
