# RecycleX: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleX connects industrial waste producers with manufacturers who need recycled materials. Think "Alibaba for trash that's worth money" - we match companies dumping plastic, metal, and paper waste with factories that can turn it into products.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $120 billion annually disposing of recyclable materials while other manufacturers pay premium prices for the same materials virgin [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We pay $3,500/month to haul away scrap polyethylene, then our neighbor two miles away buys virgin PE for $1,200/ton. It's insane."

The current recycling supply chain is completely broken. Waste producers use local haulers who charge by weight regardless of material value. These haulers sell to brokers who add 40-60% markup before reaching end users. There's zero price transparency - the same bale of cardboard sells for $45 in Detroit and $180 in Chicago. 

Companies literally burn money because finding buyers is too hard. General Motors' Lordstown plant destroyed 50 tons of aluminum scrap last quarter because their regular buyer went bankrupt and they couldn't find alternatives fast enough. The purchasing manager spent 72 hours calling brokers - none could handle the volume within the required timeframe.

## The Solution

RecycleX creates instant matches between waste and demand. Upload a photo of your material stream, get five verified bids within 2 hours. Our computer vision API identifies material grade, contamination levels, and market value in seconds. Buyers see standardized quality reports instead of blurry photos and vague descriptions.

The magic moment: A Kentucky distillery uploaded their grain waste at 9 AM, had three competitive bids by lunch, and scheduled pickup for the next day. They went from paying $8,000/month for disposal to earning $12,000/month selling to a cattle feed producer 47 miles away. That's a $240,000 annual swing.

We're 10x better because we eliminate the middlemen completely. Direct producer-to-manufacturer transactions cut costs by 35-70%. Our quality verification system reduced dispute rates from the industry average of 18% to under 2%. Average transaction time: 14 hours versus the industry standard of 6-8 weeks.

Early pilot with 12 companies: $1.8M in completed transactions, 67% repeat rate within 30 days.

## Market Size

The U.S. industrial recycling market hit $68 billion in 2024, growing at 8.3% annually [2]. But that's just what gets recycled - another $450 billion in recyclable materials goes to landfills each year according to EPA data.

Bottom-up: 320,000 U.S. manufacturers produce recyclable waste. Average company could save/earn $180,000 annually through our platform. At $3,000/month subscription: $11.5 billion opportunity just in the U.S.

Asia-Pacific recycling markets are growing 14% yearly driven by China's manufacturing boom and raw material shortages [3]. Cross-border recycling trade will hit $240 billion by 2027. We're positioning to capture the digital infrastructure layer of this explosion.

## Business Model

We charge 3% transaction fee plus $2,000-10,000/month for unlimited listings based on volume. A typical mid-size manufacturer doing $500K in annual recycling transactions pays us $29,000/year - their ROI is 8.3x from better prices alone.

Unit economics from our pilot: CAC of $3,200, 14-month LTV of $47,000, 68% gross margin after payment processing and verification costs. One enterprise client doing $5M+ annual volume pays $120,000/year.

Path to $100M ARR: 2,000 active traders at average $50K/year by month 30. Our current pipeline has 847 qualified leads from just word-of-mouth. Network effects kick in hard - each supplier attracts 3.7 buyers on average, each buyer brings 2.1 suppliers.

## Why Now?

China's "National Sword" policy banned waste imports in 2018, creating 12 million tons of excess recycling capacity in the U.S. that needs new domestic buyers [4]. Simultaneously, virgin material prices spiked 47% since 2021 due to supply chain disruptions, making recycled materials economically competitive for the first time.

Five years ago, computer vision couldn't reliably grade mixed waste streams. Today, our models achieve 94% accuracy on material classification - better than human inspectors. The infrastructure wasn't ready: 2019's best APIs would've cost us $50K/month in compute. Now we run everything for under $3K.

ESG reporting requirements starting January 2025 mean every public company must document recycling percentages [5]. They need verified, auditable supply chains immediately. We're the only platform providing blockchain-verified chain-of-custody from waste producer to final product.

Manufacturing reshoring added 800,000 U.S. factory jobs since 2022 - all needing raw materials while virgin supplies remain overseas.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapMonster (2M users, ~$30M revenue) and RecycleNet ($15M revenue) are listing sites - basically Craigslist for recycling. No verification, no standardization, no transaction management. Users complain about fake listings and payment fraud constantly. They take 30-45 days to close deals.

Rubicon ($600M valuation) focuses on municipal waste - completely different customer base and economics. They're optimizing garbage truck routes, not industrial material flows. Their enterprise sales cycle is 9-18 months; we close in 2 weeks.

Our unfair advantage: proprietary contamination detection models trained on 2.8M images from our pilot customers. Competitors would need 18 months and $10M to replicate our dataset. Plus, we have exclusive partnerships with three major shipping companies for discounted freight rates - 22% cheaper than spot market.

Network effects create our moat. Every transaction improves our pricing algorithm. Suppliers won't multi-list when we deliver 3x more buyers. Buyers stay because we aggregate supply they can't find elsewhere.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Commodity price volatility** could freeze trading during crashes. Mitigation: Our subscription model provides baseline revenue. We're adding price hedging tools and long-term contracts to smooth volatility.

**Regulatory complexity** varies dramatically by state/material. Mitigation: Partnered with environmental law firm Beveridge & Diamond. Building compliance automation that becomes a competitive advantage.

**Enterprise adoption speed** in traditional industries. Mitigation: Starting with tech-forward segments (electronics, automotive) where sustainability mandates force rapid adoption. One Fortune 500 customer validates the entire model.

Why hasn't Waste Management done this? They make 65% margins on hauling fees - a marketplace would cannibalize their core business. They're actively fighting recycling transparency through lobbying.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 50 verified suppliers, 150 buyers, $500K GMV
**90 days**: $2M monthly GMV, 500 active users, two enterprise contracts
**6 months**: $5M monthly GMV, Series A metrics (40% MoM growth)
**12 months**: $15M monthly GMV, expand to Mexico/Canada
