# RecycleX: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleX is a digital marketplace connecting industrial waste producers with manufacturers who need recycled materials. Think "Alibaba for scrap" - we match companies with excess plastic, metal, paper, and e-waste to buyers who can use these materials as production inputs, handling logistics and quality verification.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $120 billion annually on virgin materials while 85% of industrial waste goes to landfills [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We'd save $400K yearly using recycled PET, but finding reliable suppliers takes 40+ hours per month of phone calls and site visits."

Current solutions fail because industrial recycling operates through fragmented networks of brokers, each controlling small regional supplies. Buyers can't verify material quality until shipment arrives. Sellers sit on inventory for 3-6 months waiting for the right buyer. Price discovery is opaque - the same aluminum scrap varies 40% in price within 50 miles.

A paper mill in Georgia needs 500 tons of recycled cardboard monthly. They currently work with 12 different suppliers, manually tracking availability via spreadsheets and WhatsApp. Last month, two shipments arrived contaminated, costing them $75,000 in production delays.

## The Solution

RecycleX digitizes the entire transaction in 48 hours versus the current 3-week average. Sellers upload material specs and photos, our AI grades quality instantly using computer vision trained on 100,000 material samples. Buyers see real-time inventory across all suppliers with transparent pricing.

The magic moment: A buyer searches "HDPE plastic pellets," sees 15 available lots with quality scores, prices, and delivery times. One click generates a purchase order with guaranteed quality standards. We handle logistics through our network of 200+ verified haulers.

Early pilot with 20 companies: Average transaction time dropped from 21 days to 2 days. Material rejection rates fell 78%. Sellers moved inventory 4x faster. Buyers saved 22% on material costs through price transparency and reduced broker fees.

Our quality verification system uses spectroscopy data from handheld scanners ($2,000 devices) that sellers use to upload material fingerprints, eliminating the trust problem that kills 30% of recycling deals.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $58 billion in 2024, growing 14% annually as manufacturers face regulatory pressure and supply chain constraints [2]. In the U.S. alone, 4,000 large manufacturers spend $18 billion yearly on recycled inputs.

Bottom-up: 50,000 U.S. manufacturing facilities × $300K average annual recycled material spend × 5% platform fee = $750M annual GMV opportunity. Europe adds another $600M using same assumptions.

ESG mandates are accelerating adoption - the EU requires 30% recycled content in plastic packaging by 2030 [3]. Major brands like Unilever and P&G committed to 50% recycled plastic by 2025, creating desperate demand for quality supplies.

## Business Model

We charge 3% transaction fee to buyers, 2% to sellers (5% total take rate). At $50K average transaction size, we net $2,500 per deal. Additional revenue from quality verification ($500/audit) and logistics coordination (10% of freight cost).

Current unit economics from pilot: CAC of $2,000 (inside sales), 18-month LTV of $45,000 (customer does 3 transactions/month at $50K each). 65% gross margins after payment processing and support costs.

Path to $100M ARR: 1,000 active buyers doing 2 transactions monthly at $75K average = $90M net revenue. Our pilot shows companies increase transaction frequency 3x after first successful deal. Network effects kick in at 500 suppliers - more inventory attracts buyers, more buyers attract suppliers.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this possible today: (1) Commodity prices jumped 40% since 2020, making recycled materials economically compelling [4]. (2) ESG reporting requirements (SEC rules effective 2024) force companies to track recycled content. (3) Computer vision can now accurately grade material quality from photos - impossible until 2022.

Five years ago, virgin materials were cheaper than recycled. Quality verification required physical inspection. No regulatory pressure existed. Today, recycled aluminum costs 35% less than virgin, companies face fines for missing recycling targets, and AI can grade materials remotely with 94% accuracy.

By 2030, this market will be dominated by 2-3 platforms. Manufacturing procurement is going digital - 72% of purchasing managers now prefer online sourcing [5]. The winner will have the most supply liquidity.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapMonster (200K users, $15M revenue) lists materials but doesn't handle transactions. Rubicon ($1.2B valuation) focuses on waste management, not material trading. Rheaply targets office furniture, not industrial materials.

Our unfair advantage: We're building the quality verification layer competitors lack. Our computer vision model trained on actual contamination data from 50 recycling facilities. Competitors list materials; we guarantee quality with 98% accuracy, backed by insurance.

Defensibility comes from liquidity. Once we have 1,000+ suppliers, buyers won't check multiple platforms. Our 48-hour transaction guarantee creates switching costs - companies integrate our API into their procurement systems. We're moving 10x faster than competitors, adding 50 suppliers weekly versus ScrapMonster's 20.

Incumbents can't pivot - brokers lose their 15-20% margins in our model. ScrapMonster's revenue depends on listing fees that our transaction model eliminates.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Quality disputes kill trust**. Mitigation: Insurance-backed quality guarantee, third-party audits, escrow payments until delivery confirmed.

**Risk 2: Suppliers bypass platform after first transaction**. Mitigation: We handle logistics/payments (adding value beyond matching), multi-supplier orders create lock-in, volume discounts incentivize platform use.

**Risk 3: Economic downturn reduces material demand**. Mitigation: Recycled materials are countercyclical - companies switch from virgin to recycled when margins compress.

Why hasn't Alibaba done this? Industrial recycling requires local logistics networks and quality expertise they lack. U.S. manufacturers won't trust a Chinese platform with supply chain data.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 10 enterprise buyers (Fortune 1000)
**90 days**: 100 verified suppliers, $1M GMV
**6 months**: $5M monthly GMV, Series A metrics
**12 months**: 1,000 suppliers, $15M monthly GMV
