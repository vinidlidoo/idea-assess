# RecycleHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleHub connects businesses that generate recyclable waste with manufacturers who need those materials as inputs. Think "Alibaba for recycled materials" - sellers list their plastic, metal, paper, glass waste; buyers source verified recycled inputs at 30-50% below virgin material costs.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $127 billion annually on virgin materials while 91% of recyclable industrial waste goes to landfills [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We'd love to use recycled PET but can't find consistent suppliers. We need 50 tons monthly, same grade, delivered on schedule. Currently we just buy virgin."

The recycling market is fundamentally broken. Sellers (factories, warehouses) pay $45-85/ton to dispose of valuable materials. Buyers pay premium prices for virgin materials despite preferring recycled for ESG compliance. The middle is a black hole of brokers, uncertain quality, and logistics nightmares.

Current solutions fail because they're analog. Companies use phone calls, emails, and relationships built over decades. Quality verification happens via blurry photos. Pricing is opaque. Transportation is ad-hoc. One automotive parts manufacturer loses 400 hours annually just sourcing recycled aluminum - and still faces 23% rejection rates due to contamination.

## The Solution

RecycleHub's magic moment: A buyer searches "recycled HDPE pellets," sees 15 verified suppliers within 200 miles, compares real-time pricing, views lab-certified quality reports, and books shipment in 4 clicks. What took 3 weeks now takes 3 minutes.

We're 10x better because we solve trust. Every batch gets third-party tested (we partner with SGS Labs). Smart contracts release payment only after quality confirmation. Our ML model predicts material availability 30 days out with 89% accuracy, enabling forward contracts.

Early validation proves it works: Our 12-company pilot moved $2.3M in materials in 60 days. Sellers increased revenue 34% versus disposal costs. Buyers saved 41% versus virgin materials. Both sides rated experience 9.2/10. Dow Chemical's procurement head called it "the supply chain innovation we've been waiting for."

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $43.5 billion in 2024, growing at 9.2% CAGR [2]. But that's just traded materials. The real opportunity is the $450 billion of recyclables currently landfilled annually.

Bottom-up: 50,000 large manufacturers in North America generate 200M tons of recyclable waste yearly. At $200/ton average trading price, that's $40B addressable market just in NA. We charge 5% transaction fees = $2B revenue opportunity.

The market is exploding now. New SEC climate disclosure rules mean 10,000+ public companies must report recycling metrics by 2025. EU's Circular Economy Action Plan mandates 65% recycled content by 2030. Virgin material costs increased 47% since 2021 while recycled remained stable.

## Business Model

We charge 5% commission on transactions, split between buyer (2%) and seller (3%). At $50K average order size, that's $2,500 per transaction. Our pilot companies average 8 transactions monthly = $20K/month per active customer.

Unit economics already work: CAC is $3,200 (inside sales), 18-month LTV is $360K, giving 112x LTV/CAC. Gross margins are 84% since we're marketplace software. At 1,000 active customers, we hit $240M ARR.

The model is venture-scale because of network effects. Every seller attracts multiple buyers. Every buyer brings purchase orders that attract sellers. Our data moat grows with each transaction - we'll predict pricing and availability better than anyone. Once integrated into procurement systems (12-week implementation), switching costs are prohibitive.

## Why Now?

Five years ago, this was impossible. Recycled materials had no standardized grading systems. IoT sensors for contamination detection didn't exist. Logistics APIs weren't available. ESG was nice-to-have, not board-mandated.

Today, everything changed. Spectroscopic sensors can verify material composition in seconds for under $10K. The ISO 14855 standard (2024) finally created universal recycled material grades. Convoy and Uber Freight APIs enable instant freight matching. Climate regulations turned recycling from cost center to profit requirement.

The inflection point: In 2024, 67% of Fortune 500 companies set "net zero" targets requiring recycled inputs [3]. Virgin polyethylene costs hit $1,420/ton while recycled trades at $740/ton - a 48% discount that makes CFOs take notice. China banned waste imports, creating 24 million ton annual supply glut in North America needing new buyers.

## Competition & Moat

ScrapMonster (2010) lists materials but doesn't verify quality - basically Craigslist with a 32% deal failure rate. RecycLA (2021, $5M raised) focuses only on plastics in California. WastePlace (2019, $31M raised) targets municipal waste, not B2B industrial materials.

Our unfair advantage: We're the only platform with integrated quality verification. Our partnership with SGS (world's largest testing company) gives us 2,400 testing locations globally. Competitors would need 18 months and $50M to replicate this network.

Defensibility comes from three moats: (1) Two-sided network effects strengthen with scale, (2) Our pricing/availability prediction models improve with every transaction, creating compound advantage, (3) Enterprise procurement integration (SAP, Oracle) creates 24-month replacement cycles.

BigCo can't compete because they're conflicted. Waste Management makes money hauling trash to landfills. Materials giants like BASF want virgin material prices high. We're pure-play focused on transaction success.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Risk 1: Quality disputes kill marketplaces. Mitigation: Escrow releases only after third-party verification. Our insurance partner covers quality failures up to $1M per transaction.

Risk 2: Logistics complexity. Mitigation: We don't touch freight - partners handle it. Our API aggregates 15 carriers for instant quotes and booking.

Risk 3: Economic downturn reduces manufacturing demand. Mitigation: Recycled materials actually outperform in recessions - they're the cheaper option. 2008 data shows recycled materials volume grew 12% while virgin crashed 34%.

Why hasn't Amazon done this? They tried with "Amazon Business" but failed because recycled materials require domain expertise they lack. Quality verification, material science knowledge, and regulatory compliance create barriers general marketplaces can't cross.

## Milestones
