# RecycleHub: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleHub connects companies with excess recyclable materials to businesses that need raw materials. Think "Alibaba for recycled plastics, metals, and paper" - sellers list their recyclables, buyers bid or buy directly, we handle logistics and quality verification.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies lose $14 billion annually on virgin material costs while recyclables worth $7.5 billion end up in landfills [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We'd save $300K yearly using recycled PET, but finding reliable suppliers takes 40+ hours monthly and half the shipments fail quality checks."

Current recycling is broken. Sellers dump materials at whatever price local recyclers offer - often 70% below market value. Buyers can't find consistent supply, waste weeks on procurement, and get burned by contaminated loads. Small manufacturers get squeezed out entirely - they need 5 tons monthly but suppliers only talk at 50+ tons. The fragmented market has 12,000+ potential suppliers and 45,000+ buyers who can't efficiently connect. One automotive parts maker spent $1.2M extra last year on virgin plastics because they couldn't source recycled consistently.

## The Solution

Buyers log in, search "recycled PET flakes, 10 tons, food-grade" and see 15 verified suppliers with real-time pricing. They click buy, we handle pickup, testing, and delivery - materials arrive in 72 hours, quality guaranteed.

The magic moment: A packaging company saves $40K on their first order by switching from virgin to recycled plastics, delivered faster than their current supplier. We're 10x better because we aggregate supply (solving consistency), pre-verify quality (eliminating bad shipments), and enable instant transactions (cutting procurement from weeks to minutes).

Early pilot with 12 companies: 89% cost savings versus virgin materials, 5-day delivery average, zero quality rejections. Our platform matches materials using chemical fingerprinting data - buyers know exactly what they're getting. We've already facilitated $2.3M in transactions during our 3-month beta.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $51.2 billion in 2024, growing at 6.8% annually [2]. In the US alone: 35,000 manufacturers spend $280 billion yearly on raw materials, with 15% actively seeking recycled alternatives - that's $42 billion in addressable market.

Bottom-up: 45,000 US manufacturers × average $750K annual recycled material spend × 3% platform fee = $1.01 billion revenue opportunity. The market is exploding: virgin material costs rose 23% since 2022 while ESG mandates now require 30% recycled content by 2027 [3]. California's SB-54 alone creates $8 billion in forced recycled material demand.

## Business Model

We charge 3% transaction fee plus $99/month SaaS for analytics. Large buyers pay $999/month for dedicated sourcing support. Suppliers list free, pay 2% on successful sales.

Unit economics: CAC of $1,200 (trade show acquisition), LTV of $45,000 (15-month average retention × $3,000 monthly GMV × 3% take rate). Gross margins at 67% after logistics partnerships. Path to $100M ARR: 1,100 active buyers doing $300M annual GMV. Current trajectory gets us there in 30 months based on 47% month-over-month GMV growth.

## Why Now?

Three shifts make this inevitable: (1) Virgin material costs hit record highs - polyethylene up 43% since 2022 [4], (2) New ESG regulations require traceable recycled content - $500K penalties for non-compliance starting 2025, (3) AI-powered quality verification became commercially viable - spectroscopy costs dropped 90% enabling instant material validation.

Five years ago: No demand (virgin was cheaper), no verification tech (quality was gambling), no regulatory pressure. Today: Manufacturers desperate for alternatives, instant quality testing via portable spectrometers, and governments mandating recycled content. The tipping point: Extended Producer Responsibility laws now affect 67% of US manufacturers, forcing them to source recycled or pay massive fees [5].

## Competition & Moat

ScrapLink raised $12M, has 2,000 users, focuses only on metals - they miss 70% of the market. WastePlace does $30M GMV but requires phone calls for every transaction - we're fully automated. Rheaply pivoted to office furniture after failing in materials.

Our unfair advantage: proprietary quality verification network (15 testing partners giving instant certification), direct integration with 8 major logistics providers (competitors use brokers), and exclusive data partnership with the Recycling Association giving us pricing intelligence competitors can't access. Network effects kick in at 500 suppliers - buyers get better selection, attracting more buyers, attracting more suppliers. Switching costs compound: buyers integrate our API for procurement, build workflows around our quality guarantees, and rely on our financing options.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Quality inconsistency**: Materials vary wildly batch-to-batch. Mitigation: Mandatory pre-verification through our testing network, insurance on every transaction, supplier ratings system removing bottom 10% monthly.

**Logistics complexity**: Shipping recycled materials requires specialized handling. Mitigation: Exclusive partnership with Clean Earth Logistics (12,000 trucks), automated routing optimization, regional hub strategy reducing last-mile costs 40%.

**Economic downturn**: Recycling demand drops in recessions. Mitigation: Focus on cost-savings value prop (stronger in downturns), expand to non-cyclical industries (packaging, agriculture), build recurring SaaS revenue stream. 

Why hasn't Alibaba done this? They tried in 2019, shut down after 8 months - couldn't solve quality verification without feet on the ground. We have both tech and physical presence.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Sign 50 verified suppliers in Ohio/Michigan corridor
**90 days**: $500K monthly GMV with 20% month-over-month growth
**6 months**: 200 active buyers, $2M monthly GMV, Series A metrics proven
**12 months**: $10M ARR run rate, expand to 5 states, close Series A
