# RecycleX: B2B Marketplace for Recycled Materials

## What We Do

RecycleX is a digital marketplace connecting industrial waste producers with manufacturers who need recycled materials. Think "Alibaba for recycled plastics, metals, and paper" - we match sellers who have tons of recyclable waste with buyers who want cheaper raw materials.

## The Problem

Manufacturing companies waste $120 billion annually on virgin materials while 91% of recyclable industrial waste ends up in landfills [1]. A plastics manufacturer in Ohio told us: "We spend 6 hours per week calling around to find recycled PET pellets, often paying 40% more than we should because we can't see market prices."

Current recycled material sourcing is broken: buyers make 15-20 phone calls to find materials, sellers dump valuable waste because they can't find buyers fast enough, pricing is opaque with 30-50% spreads between regions, quality verification requires physical samples taking 2-3 weeks, and logistics coordination adds another week of delays.

Companies literally lose deals worth $50K-500K because they can't source materials within production deadlines. One automotive parts supplier missed a $2M contract because they couldn't secure recycled aluminum in time.

## The Solution

Buyers log in, search "recycled PET pellets," see 47 verified suppliers with real-time pricing, filter by quality grade and location, and purchase 20 tons with one click. Materials arrive in 72 hours with blockchain-verified quality certificates.

Our platform aggregates supply from 2,000+ waste producers, provides instant quality verification through computer vision (95% accuracy), offers transparent spot and contract pricing updated hourly, handles logistics through integrated 3PL partners, and processes payments with trade financing options.

Early pilot with 12 manufacturers: 73% reduction in sourcing time (from 6 hours to 1.6 hours weekly), 24% average cost savings on materials, 89% faster order fulfillment. Beta user Ford Motors subsidiary: "This saved us $1.2M in Q2 alone on recycled aluminum sourcing."

The magic: AI-powered matching algorithm predicts material availability 30 days out with 82% accuracy, enabling just-in-time procurement.

## Market Size

The global recycled materials market hit $52.3 billion in 2024, growing at 7.8% CAGR through 2030 [2]. U.S. market alone: $14.7 billion with 127,000 potential customers (manufacturers spending >$1M annually on raw materials).

Bottom-up: 127,000 manufacturers Ã— $25K average platform fees = $3.2B addressable market. Add transaction fees (2.5% of $14.7B GMV) = additional $367M opportunity.

Corporate sustainability mandates are accelerating adoption: 73% of Fortune 500 companies now require recycled content minimums [3]. New SEC climate disclosure rules effective 2025 will force transparency on material sourcing.

## Business Model

We charge 2.5% transaction fee on all trades plus $2,000-10,000/month SaaS fee for premium analytics. Average customer processes $400K monthly = $10K transaction fees + $5K subscription = $15K monthly revenue per customer.

Unit economics: CAC of $3,500 (inside sales), 18-month payback, $270K LTV, 77% gross margin after logistics costs. Path to $100M ARR: 600 active enterprise accounts by year 3 (currently at 47 paying pilots).

Network effects compound value: more suppliers attract buyers, creating pricing efficiency that further attracts both sides. At 10,000 participants, we become the de facto price discovery mechanism for recycled materials.

## Why Now?

China's 2024 waste import ban redirected 47 million tons of recyclable materials, creating massive U.S. oversupply and 40% price drops [4]. Simultaneously, new Extended Producer Responsibility laws in 12 states mandate 30%+ recycled content by 2026.

Five years ago: no quality standards for recycled materials, manual paper-based procurement, limited corporate sustainability focus. Today: ISO 14855 standards widespread, 84% of procurement digitized, sustainability tied to executive compensation at 67% of large manufacturers [5].

In five years: recycled materials procurement will be 100% digital, AI-driven, with real-time pricing. Companies not using platforms like ours will be competitively disadvantaged by 20-30% on material costs.

January 2025 data: recycled PET demand up 47% YoY while virgin PET only up 3% - the flip is happening now [6].

## Competition & Moat

Direct competitors: ScrapMonster ($8M raised, 50K users but consumer-focused), RecycleMatch (acquired by ISS for $20M, limited to paper/cardboard), Rubicon (IPO'd at $2B but focused on waste management, not materials trading).

ScrapMonster has traction but targets small scrap dealers - average transaction $5K vs our $85K. RecycleMatch had the right idea but single-category focus limited network effects. Rubicon manages waste collection, doesn't facilitate materials trading.

Our unfair advantages: proprietary quality verification AI trained on 2M+ samples, exclusive partnerships with top 10 waste management companies for supply, embedded integration with SAP/Oracle procurement systems, and first-mover advantage in automotive/aerospace segments (42% market share).

Speed advantage: shipping recycled materials marketplace features weekly while competitors update quarterly. Our 7-person eng team moves faster than Rubicon's 200+ engineers.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Commodity price volatility** could reduce margins - we're building hedging products and long-term contracts to smooth volatility. Already testing futures contracts with CME Group.

**Quality inconsistency** could damage trust - our computer vision system catches 95% of quality issues, with insurance covering the remainder. Zero quality claims in last 500 transactions.

**Regulatory fragmentation** across states - we're actively shaping standards through leadership in Recycling Industry Association, ensuring favorable frameworks.

If Amazon enters this space? They lack industry relationships and domain expertise. Materials trading requires deep technical knowledge Amazon won't prioritize for a $15B market.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Close 10 enterprise pilots ($150K MRR)
**90 days**: Launch v2 with automated quality verification
**6 months**: $500K MRR, Series A metrics achieved
**12 months**: $2M MRR, category leader in plastics/metals
