# LegacyAI: AI-Powered Code Review for Legacy Codebases

## What We Do

LegacyAI is like having a senior developer who never sleeps reviewing your old code. We scan COBOL, Java, and other legacy codebases to find bugs, security issues, and maintenance problems. Our AI understands code written 30 years ago and tells you exactly what needs fixing - before it breaks production.

## The Problem

Fortune 500 companies are drowning in 800 billion lines of legacy COBOL code that runs 80% of global transactions [1]. "We spend 75% of our IT budget just keeping lights on," says a banking CTO. The average legacy system costs $30 million annually to maintain [2]. Meanwhile, COBOL developers are retiring faster than they're replaced - creating a skills crisis where contractors charge $500/hour.

Last month, a major airline grounded 2,000 flights due to a COBOL bug nobody caught. Banks delay critical updates for months because nobody understands their 1980s mainframe code. Healthcare systems run on code so old that the original developers are deceased. Current tools like SonarQube can't parse COBOL properly, and manual reviews take weeks per module.

## The Solution

Upload your legacy codebase, and within minutes LegacyAI highlights critical issues ranked by business impact. The magic moment: seeing a 40-year-old memory leak that's been costing $100K monthly in mainframe cycles. We're 10x better because we understand COBOL semantics, not just syntax - catching logic bombs that static analyzers miss entirely.

The US Social Security Administration is already using AI to modernize their $1 billion COBOL upgrade [3]. Our pilot with a regional bank found 47 production-threatening bugs in their payment system - bugs that survived three manual audits. We reduce code review time from 3 weeks to 3 hours while catching 5x more issues. One client saved $2 million in prevented outages within six months.

## Market Size

The AI code tools market reaches $6.11 billion in 2024, growing at 27.1% annually to hit $26 billion by 2030 [4]. With 92% of enterprises still using COBOL strategically [5], and each spending $30 million yearly on maintenance, the legacy modernization segment alone represents a $15 billion opportunity.

10,000 enterprises globally Ã— $1.5 million average contract = $15 billion TAM. The market is exploding because AI can finally understand legacy languages, and the COBOL developer shortage forces automation. Companies previously had no choice but expensive contractors - now they have LegacyAI.

## Business Model

$50,000 per year per million lines of code, with most enterprises having 5-10 million lines. Average contract value: $375,000 annually. Our CAC is $15,000 (mostly enterprise sales), while LTV exceeds $1.5 million (4-year average retention) - giving us a 100:1 LTV/CAC ratio.

Path to $100M ARR: 10 customers by month 6, 50 by year 1, 300 by year 2. High gross margins (85%) since compute costs are minimal after initial model training. Codacy and similar tools prove the subscription model, while Codeium's recent $1.25 billion valuation validates investor appetite [6].

## Why Now?

Large language models can finally understand COBOL semantics, not just syntax - impossible before 2023's breakthrough models. Five years ago, AI couldn't parse nested COBOL copybooks or mainframe JCL. Five years from now, every legacy system will require AI review as human COBOL developers become extinct.

The inflection point: 63% of developers now use AI coding tools daily [7], normalizing AI code review. Meanwhile, enterprises spend $2.9 million on average just for legacy upgrades in 2023 [8]. The first company to crack legacy code review captures a decade of pent-up demand before competitors catch up.

## Competition & Moat

DeepCode (Snyk) focuses on modern languages, charging $25/month for JavaScript - they explicitly don't support COBOL. Codacy handles Java but not mainframe dialects. GitHub Copilot helps write new code but can't review legacy systems. IBM's watsonX attempts COBOL but requires massive consulting engagements starting at $5 million.

Our moat: 5 billion lines of COBOL training data from public government systems, giving us 18 months' head start. We're building network effects where each customer's codebase improves our models. Big Tech won't compete because legacy modernization isn't sexy enough for their growth targets - Google wants billions of users, not 10,000 enterprise contracts. We move fast while IBM takes 18 months to update their tools.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

First risk: enterprises are notoriously slow adopters. Mitigation: start with urgent compliance requirements (SOC2, PCI-DSS) where they must act. Second risk: accuracy on proprietary COBOL variants. Mitigation: on-premises learning mode that adapts to customer-specific code patterns within 30 days.

Third risk: "Why hasn't Microsoft done this?" They have - but only for modern languages where they have billions of users. Legacy code is a large but finite market that doesn't fit their scale requirements. The unique insight others miss: the real risk isn't competition but enterprises choosing to do nothing - which is why we focus on preventing outages, not features.

## Milestones

- 30 days: 3 paid pilots with Fortune 1000 companies ($50K each)
- 90 days: $125K MRR from 5 enterprise customers
- 6 months: $500K MRR, 15 customers, Series A conversations
- 12 months: $2M ARR, 40 customers, close Series A
