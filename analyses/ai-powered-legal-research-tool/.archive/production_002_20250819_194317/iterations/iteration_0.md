# LexisLogic: AI Legal Research That Actually Understands Law

## 1. What We Do

LexisLogic is legal research software that reads cases like a senior partner. Give it any legal question and it finds relevant precedents, synthesizes holdings, and drafts research memos in minutes instead of hours. Think Google Scholar meets a Harvard Law graduate who never sleeps.

## 2. The Problem

Junior associates at AM Law 200 firms bill $400/hour but spend 40% of their time on basic legal research [1]. A partner at Davis Polk told us: "My first-years spend 8 hours finding cases that a good paralegal with 20 years experience could find in 2. But we don't have those paralegals anymore." The average complex litigation matter requires 300+ hours of legal research at $120,000 in billable time [2].

Current tools are glorified keyword searches. Westlaw and Lexis require exact terminology - search "workplace harassment" and miss cases about "hostile work environment." Their new AI tools hallucinate 33% of the time according to Stanford research [3]. Meanwhile, lawyers only achieve 2.9 billable hours daily because they're drowning in inefficient research workflows [4].

One litigation boutique partner described their breaking point: "We lost a motion because we missed a circuit split. The case was there, but our associate searched 'contractual breach' instead of 'breach of contract.' That's a $2M malpractice claim waiting to happen."

## 3. The Solution

LexisLogic understands legal concepts, not just keywords. Upload a complaint, and within 90 seconds it identifies every legal issue, finds supporting and opposing precedent across all jurisdictions, and generates a research memo with proper citations. Our semantic engine trained on 10 million judicial opinions achieves 94% recall on relevant cases versus 67% for traditional Boolean searches.

Early pilot with Quinn Emanuel: Research time dropped from 12 hours to 45 minutes per motion. Partners could review comprehensive research packages instead of hoping associates found everything. One partner reported: "It's like having a Supreme Court clerk who's read every case ever written."

The magic: We parse legal reasoning, not just text. Our model understands that "piercing the corporate veil" relates to "alter ego liability" and "instrumentality doctrine." It tracks how legal standards evolve across circuits and identifies when judges cite cases for propositions they don't actually support.

Measurable impact: 75% reduction in research hours, 99.2% citation accuracy, 3x more relevant cases found per search.

## 4. Market Size

The legal AI market hit $1.9B in 2024, growing at 27.6% CAGR to reach $8.9B by 2030 [5]. Bottom-up calculation: 450,000 litigation attorneys in the US � $12,000 annual subscription = $5.4B domestic opportunity. Add corporate legal departments (30,000 companies � 5 licenses � $15,000) = additional $2.25B.

Legal research specifically represents 24% of the legal AI market, or $456M today [6]. The broader legal tech market reached $26.7B in 2024, with research tools capturing increasing share as firms modernize [7]. Key accelerant: 67% of corporate legal departments expect AI to fundamentally change billing models within 24 months [8].

## 5. Business Model

We charge $1,000/month per attorney for unlimited research. Large firms pay $800/seat at 100+ licenses. This prices at 20% of what firms bill for the research time we save - immediate ROI. Current pilots show lawyers save 30 hours monthly, worth $12,000 in billables.

Unit economics: $120 CAC through law school partnerships, $12,000 annual contract value, 95% gross margins on compute costs of $50/user/month. Net revenue retention: 140% as firms expand seats after seeing productivity gains.

Path to $100M ARR: 1,000 firms � 100 seats � $10,000 average price. We're already at $8M ARR after 14 months, adding 50 new firms monthly. Harvey AI just hit $100M ARR with a broader platform - we'll beat that focused solely on research excellence [9].

## 6. Why Now?

GPT-4's 2023 launch made legal reasoning possible - it passed the bar exam at 90th percentile. But general models hallucinate on legal queries. We fine-tuned on 50TB of verified legal text, achieving lawyer-level accuracy. Five years ago, the compute would've cost $10M. Today it's $50K.

The legal profession hit an inflection point: 77% of attorneys report burnout from billable hour pressure [10]. Firms can't hire fast enough - law school enrollment dropped 30% over the last decade. Meanwhile, litigation complexity increased 4x with average cases involving 1.5M documents.

Holy shit statistic: In 2024, Harvey AI went from $0 to $100M ARR in 24 months, reaching a $5B valuation - the fastest growth in legal tech history [11]. The entire industry just realized AI actually works.

## 7. Competition & Moat

**Thomson Reuters (Westlaw)**: $6.2B revenue, but their AI hallucinates 33% of the time [3]. They acquired Casetext for $650M but integration takes years. Slow enterprise sales cycles.

**LexisNexis**: $2.8B revenue, 17% hallucination rate on AI features [3]. Legacy architecture can't handle semantic search properly.

**Harvey AI**: $100M ARR, $5B valuation [11]. Broader platform play - we're 10x better at pure research because that's all we do.

Our moat: 18-month head start on legal-specific fine-tuning. Our training data includes 10M opinions we've manually verified for citation accuracy - competitors would need 50 legal experts working full-time for 2 years to replicate. Network effect: Every search improves our relevance algorithm. We're already the default at 15 top law schools, capturing lawyers before they develop tool loyalty.

Speed advantage: 2-week deployment vs 6-month enterprise sales cycles. We're adding a new firm daily while competitors run POCs.

## 8. Key Risks & Mitigation

**Malpractice liability**: If we miss a case, firms could sue. Mitigation: $50M E&O insurance, disclaimers requiring human review, 99.2% accuracy rate beats human researchers at 87%.

**Bar regulatory approval**: Some states restrict AI use in legal practice. Mitigation: Partner with state bars on ethical guidelines, maintain human-in-the-loop architecture.

**Thomson Reuters launches competing product**: They have distribution but move slowly. We'll have 1,000 firms locked into 3-year contracts before they ship v1.

Why hasn't Westlaw done this? They make $3B annually from complex Boolean searches that require training. Simplifying research cannibalizes their training revenue and research librarian ecosystem. We have no legacy revenue to protect.

## 9. Milestones

**30 days**: Close 10 pilot firms from current pipeline, achieve $10M ARR run rate
**90 days**: Launch appellate brief analyzer, hit 95% accuracy on circuit split detection
**6 months**: 250 paying firms, $30M ARR, Series A metrics achieved
**12 months**: 1,000 firms on platform, $100M ARR, category leader position
