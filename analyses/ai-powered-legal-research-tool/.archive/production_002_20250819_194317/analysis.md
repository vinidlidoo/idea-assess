# LexisLogic: AI Legal Research That Actually Understands Law

## What We Do

LexisLogic is Perplexity for legal research. Give it any legal question and it finds relevant precedents, synthesizes holdings, and drafts research memos in minutes instead of hours. We turn 12-hour research projects into 45-minute reviews.

## The Problem

"We lost a motion because we missed a circuit split. The case was there, but our associate searched 'contractual breach' instead of 'breach of contract.' That's a $2M malpractice claim waiting to happen." - Litigation boutique partner describing their breaking point with current legal research tools.

Junior associates at AM Law 200 firms bill $400/hour but spend 40% of their time on basic legal research [1]. The average complex litigation matter requires 300+ hours of legal research at $120,000 in billable time [2]. Yet lawyers only achieve 2.9 billable hours daily because they're drowning in inefficient research workflows [4].

Current tools are glorified keyword searches. Westlaw and Lexis require exact terminology - search "workplace harassment" and miss cases about "hostile work environment." Their new AI tools hallucinate 33% of the time according to Stanford research [3]. A partner at Davis Polk told us: "My first-years spend 8 hours finding cases that a good paralegal with 20 years experience could find in 2. But we don't have those paralegals anymore."

## The Solution

LexisLogic understands legal concepts, not just keywords. Upload a complaint, and within 90 seconds it identifies every legal issue, finds supporting and opposing precedent across all jurisdictions, and generates a research memo with proper citations. Our transformer-based semantic engine uses a custom legal knowledge graph trained on 10 million judicial opinions to achieve 94% recall on relevant cases versus 67% for traditional Boolean searches.

Early pilot with Quinn Emanuel: Research time dropped from 12 hours to 45 minutes per motion. Partners could review comprehensive research packages instead of hoping associates found everything. One partner reported: "It's like having a Supreme Court clerk who's read every case ever written."

The technical difference: While GPT-4 uses general transformer architecture, we built a legal-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system with a proprietary citation verification layer. Our model understands that "piercing the corporate veil" relates to "alter ego liability" and "instrumentality doctrine" through our custom legal ontology mapping 500,000 legal concepts. It tracks how legal standards evolve across circuits and identifies when judges cite cases for propositions they don't actually support.

Measurable impact: 75% reduction in research hours, 99.2% citation accuracy, 3x more relevant cases found per search.

## Market Size

The legal AI market hit $1.9B in 2024, growing at 27.6% CAGR to reach $8.9B by 2030 [5]. Bottom-up calculation: 450,000 litigation attorneys in the US × $12,000 annual subscription = $5.4B domestic opportunity. Add corporate legal departments (30,000 companies × 5 licenses × $15,000) = additional $2.25B.

Legal research specifically represents 24% of the legal AI market, or $456M today [6]. The broader legal tech market reached $26.7B in 2024, with research tools capturing increasing share as firms modernize [7]. Key accelerant: 67% of corporate legal departments expect AI to fundamentally change billing models within 24 months [8].

## Business Model

We charge $1,000/month per attorney for unlimited research. Large firms pay $800/seat at 100+ licenses. This prices at 20% of what firms bill for the research time we save - immediate ROI. Current pilots show lawyers save 30 hours monthly, worth $12,000 in billables.

Unit economics breakdown: $1,850 blended CAC (law school channel: $450 via student ambassadors with 8% conversion; direct sales: $3,200 with 35% close rate from demos). $12,000 annual contract value, 95% gross margins on compute costs of $50/user/month. Net revenue retention: 140% as firms expand seats after seeing productivity gains. Payback period: 2.3 months.

Path to $100M ARR with realistic timeline:

- Month 6: 50 firms × 20 seats × $10K = $10M ARR (current trajectory)
- Year 1: 150 firms × 40 seats × $11K = $66M ARR (4 enterprise reps closing 3 deals/month)
- Year 2: 350 firms × 60 seats × $10.5K = $220M ARR (scaled team, lower price for volume)
Assumes 8% annual churn based on legal tech benchmarks, 140% net retention from seat expansion.

## Why Now?

GPT-4's 2023 launch made legal reasoning possible - it passed the bar exam at 90th percentile. But general models hallucinate on legal queries. We fine-tuned on 50TB of verified legal text, achieving lawyer-level accuracy. Five years ago, the compute would've cost $10M. Today it's $50K.

The legal profession hit an inflection point: 77% of attorneys report burnout from billable hour pressure [10]. Legal AI accuracy improved 300% from 2022 to 2024, finally crossing the trust threshold for professional use. Meanwhile, litigation complexity increased 4x with average cases involving 1.5M documents.

Holy shit statistic: In 2024, Harvey AI went from $0 to $100M ARR in 24 months, reaching a $5B valuation - the fastest growth in legal tech history [11]. The entire industry just realized AI actually works.

## Competition & Moat

**Thomson Reuters (Westlaw)**: $6.2B revenue, but their AI hallucinates 33% of the time [3]. They acquired Casetext for $650M but integration takes years. Slow enterprise sales cycles.

**LexisNexis**: $2.8B revenue, 17% hallucination rate on AI features [3]. Legacy architecture can't handle semantic search properly.

**Harvey AI**: $100M ARR, $5B valuation [11]. Broader platform play - we're 10x better at pure research because that's all we do.

Our sustainable moat goes beyond the 18-month head start:

1. **Proprietary data partnerships**: Exclusive access to 2M unpublished trial court decisions through partnerships with 15 state court systems
2. **Network effects**: Every search improves our relevance algorithm. 50,000 daily searches now train our model on what lawyers actually need
3. **Integration lock-in**: Deep API integrations with document management systems (iManage, NetDocuments) create 18-month switching costs
4. **Law school monopoly**: Default tool at 45 top law schools through our student program, capturing 15,000 new lawyers annually before they develop tool loyalty
5. **Citation graph advantage**: We've mapped citation relationships between 50M legal documents - would cost competitors $15M and 3 years to replicate

Speed advantage: 2-week deployment vs 6-month enterprise sales cycles. We're adding a new firm daily while competitors run POCs.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Malpractice liability**: If we miss a case, firms could sue. Mitigation: $50M E&O insurance (based on average legal malpractice claim of $300K × potential 150 claims × risk factor). Policy scales to $100M at 500 customers. Industry standard is $25M - we're 2x covered. Disclaimers require human review, and our 99.2% accuracy beats human researchers at 87%.

**Bar regulatory approval**: Some states restrict AI use in legal practice. Mitigation: Partner with state bars on ethical guidelines (already approved in CA, NY, TX covering 60% of US lawyers), maintain human-in-the-loop architecture.

**Thomson Reuters launches competing product**: They have distribution but move slowly. We'll have 1,000 firms locked into 3-year contracts before they ship v1. Their $3B annual revenue from complex Boolean searches creates innovator's dilemma - simplifying research cannibalizes their training revenue.

Why hasn't Westlaw done this? They make $3B annually from complex Boolean searches that require training. Simplifying research cannibalizes their $400M training and research librarian ecosystem. We have no legacy revenue to protect.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Close 10 pilot firms from pipeline (8 verbal commits), achieve $10M ARR run rate
**60 days**: Launch appellate brief analyzer, onboard 2 enterprise sales reps
**90 days**: Hit 95% accuracy on circuit split detection, 75 paying firms at $18M ARR
**6 months**: 150 firms, $30M ARR, close Series A to scale sales team to 15 reps
**9 months**: Launch transactional research module, 300 firms at $60M ARR
**12 months**: 500 firms on platform, $100M ARR through expanded seat counts and enterprise deals

Monthly acceleration driven by: Month 1-3: founder-led sales, Month 4-6: first sales hires ramped, Month 7-9: enterprise team hits stride, Month 10-12: channel partnerships activate.
