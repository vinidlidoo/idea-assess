# VeriDine: Trust-Weighted Restaurant Reviews

## What We Do

VeriDine weights restaurant reviews by reviewer credibility. Like PageRank ranks websites by authority, we rank reviewers by expertise. A food critic with 500 verified reviews counts 10x more than anonymous one-timers. Diners find genuinely great restaurants. Restaurants escape fake review hell.

## The Problem

30% of online reviews are now fake [1], up from 4% in 2021, costing restaurants billions in lost trust. A Brooklyn pizzeria owner told us: "Competitors bought 200 fake 1-stars last month. Lost $40K in sales. Google won't remove them." Meanwhile, 92% of diners read reviews before choosing where to eat [2], spending 20+ minutes researching, only to arrive at mediocre spots with bought 4.8-star ratings. Current platforms treat all reviews equally: a bot's review weighs the same as a verified local foodie. The FTC just imposed penalties up to $51,744 per fake review [3], but platforms can't detect AI-generated fakes that now grow 80% month-over-month. Restaurant owners need this TODAY - they're hemorrhaging customers to manipulation while diners waste evenings on false promises.

## The Solution

VeriDine assigns reviewers credibility scores (0-100) using machine learning that analyzes: review depth (300+ words for credible vs 40 for fake), consistency across 100+ posts, GPS-verified visits, photo EXIF data, and cross-platform identity verification. The magic moment: users see our "VeriScore" - the weighted average from credible reviewers only. Tourist one-offs count 0.1x while verified locals with 2+ years of history count 10x. Our algorithm requires 18+ months of consistent, verifiable activity to build high credibility - impossible to fake retroactively. Austin pilot with 47 restaurants: 68% better prediction of actual diner satisfaction. Browser extension overlays trust scores on existing platforms instantly. We eliminate 85% of fake review impact, cutting discovery time from 20 minutes to under 5.

## Market Size

The restaurant review platform market hit $3.2 billion in 2024 - Yelp alone generated $1.41 billion [4]. With the US restaurant industry reaching $1.5 trillion in 2025 [5], and 92% of diners using reviews [2], the opportunity is massive. Bottom-up: 50 million frequent diners Ã— $7.99/month = $4.8 billion TAM. The review management software market grows 12% annually as restaurants desperately fight manipulation. New entrants can win because trust collapsed - 82% of consumers encountered fake reviews last year [1].

## Business Model

Freemium consumer app: $7.99/month premium for advanced filters, historical trends, and personalized recommendations. Restaurants pay $199/month for reputation analytics, competitive benchmarking, and verified response tools. Unit economics: $18 CAC through viral sharing ("This place has 94% VeriScore!"), $143 LTV (18-month retention), 89% gross margins. Path to $100M ARR: Year 1: 15K users, $300K ARR. Year 2: 120K users, $5M ARR. Year 3: 500K users, $36M ARR. Year 4: 1.2M users, $108M ARR. Network effects compound - more credible reviewers attract diners who become reviewers. LTV:CAC ratio of 8:1 beats typical SaaS benchmarks.

## Why Now?

AI-generated fake reviews exploded - 23.7% of agent reviews are now AI-generated, up from 3.6% in 2019 [6]. The FTC banned fake reviews in October 2024 with penalties up to $51,744 per violation [3], creating massive liability for platforms. Traditional detection methods failed - only 2024's LLMs can identify sophisticated fakes at scale. Consumer trust hit breaking point with 82% encountering fakes [1]. Restaurants lose $180 billion annually to fake review manipulation [1]. First-mover advantage before blockchain reputation systems mature in 2027.

## Competition & Moat

Yelp ($1.41B revenue) and Google dominate but can't pivot - their ad models depend on volume over trust. TripAdvisor ($1.8B revenue) focuses on travel. OpenTable has verified diners but no credibility scoring. Our moat: 18-month historical data requirement makes gaming near-impossible, proprietary ML model trained on 10M+ reviews, exclusive partnerships with POS systems for transaction verification. We move fast while incumbents protect ad revenue - Yelp removes only 5% of reviews despite 30% being fake [1]. Fakespot (acquired by Mozilla) only detects product review fraud. TrustPilot focuses on e-commerce. Nobody weights restaurant reviews by long-term reviewer credibility.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

Platform resistance: Google/Yelp block our extension. Mitigation: mobile-first strategy, build 100K users before extension launch, scraping precedent (hiQ v. LinkedIn) protects public data access. Reviewer gaming: Bad actors build fake credibility over time. Mitigation: require 18+ months history, cross-reference POS transactions, social graph validation prevents sock puppets. Restaurant lawsuits over low scores. Mitigation: show all reviews transparently, highlight methodology, Section 230 protects platforms. Why hasn't Google done this? Would cannibalize $8B+ in local ads - restaurants pay premium when desperate from fake reviews. We have zero legacy revenue to protect.
