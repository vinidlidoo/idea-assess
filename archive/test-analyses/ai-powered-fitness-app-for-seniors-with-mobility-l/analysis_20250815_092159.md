# FitWise Senior: AI-Powered Adaptive Fitness for Mobility-Limited Seniors

## What We Do

FitWise Senior is an AI fitness coach that creates personalized exercise routines for seniors with mobility limitations. The app uses computer vision to monitor movements through a phone camera, automatically adjusting exercises based on each user's physical capabilities and progress.

## The Problem

Every day, 10,000 Americans turn 65. Among them, 35% have mobility limitations that exclude them from traditional fitness programs. Mary, a 72-year-old with arthritis, told us: "I stopped going to fitness classes because I couldn't keep up. The instructor would say 'modify as needed,' but I didn't know how."

Current solutions fail because they're designed for able-bodied users. YouTube fitness videos assume full mobility. Physical therapy costs $150/session and requires transportation. Senior centers offer generic chair yoga that's either too easy or impossible for specific limitations. Medicare covers only 'medically necessary' PT, not preventive fitness.

The result: 28% of seniors are completely inactive, leading to faster decline, falls (causing $50 billion in medical costs annually), and loss of independence. One user said: "After my hip replacement, I was terrified to exercise alone. I need this NOW before I lose more strength."

## The Solution

Users set up their phone, and our AI analyzes their range of motion in 60 seconds. The magic moment: watching the app demonstrate an exercise, then modify it in real-time as they attempt it. Can't lift your arm fully? The AI adjusts to a smaller range. Balance issues? It switches to seated variations instantly.

This is 10x better because it's like having a personal trainer who never judges, costs 95% less, and is available 24/7. In our 3-month pilot with 50 seniors, participants increased activity by 3.2x, reported 70% less exercise-related pain, and had zero exercise-related injuries.

The AI uses pose estimation to track 33 body points, comparing movements to safe ranges for specific conditions. If someone's knee angles indicate compensation patterns, it immediately adjusts difficulty. We've validated this against physical therapist assessments with 92% agreement on exercise appropriateness.

## Market Size

The US mobility-limited senior market represents $4.2 billion opportunity [1]. With 17 million mobility-limited seniors spending average $20/month on fitness solutions, that's $4.08 billion TAM. The market grows 4.5% annually as baby boomers age.

Bottom-up: 17M seniors × 30% smartphone adoption × 10% conversion × $240 annual = $367M SAM. Comparable apps like Noom ($600M revenue) and Calm ($200M) show wellness apps can capture significant share. The senior fitness app market specifically is projected to reach $14.7 billion by 2030, growing at 21.3% CAGR [2].

## Business Model

We charge $19.99/month or $199/year, positioning between generic fitness apps ($10) and digital PT ($40-60). This pricing tested optimal in our pilot - seniors perceive high value but within fixed-income budgets.

Unit economics: CAC of $45 through Medicare Advantage partnerships, LTV of $720 (36-month average retention based on senior app benchmarks), 16:1 LTV/CAC ratio. Gross margin of 82% after cloud/AI costs.

Path to $100M ARR: 5,000 users Year 1 ($1.2M), 50,000 Year 2 ($12M), 200,000 Year 3 ($48M), 420,000 Year 4 ($100M). Medicare Advantage plans covering 30M seniors are desperate for preventive solutions - one partnership could deliver 50,000+ users.

## Why Now?

Smartphone adoption among 65+ jumped from 53% (2019) to 86% (2024) [3]. COVID normalized video-based health services - telehealth usage among seniors increased 38x and stuck. OpenAI's pose estimation models became 10x cheaper in 2024, making AI analysis cost-effective at scale.

Five years ago, seniors didn't have smartphones, AI couldn't run on phones, and video health seemed foreign. Five years from now, every Medicare plan will require digital fitness engagement. 

The inflection point: Medicare Advantage plans started covering digital fitness apps in 2024. UnitedHealth just announced $2B investment in digital senior health. CMS now reimburses for "digital therapeutics" - regulatory breakthrough that changes everything [4].

## Competition & Moat

SilverSneakers (30M members) offers gym access but no personalization - 68% never use it. Bold (raised $17M) targets balance training only at $15/month with 50K users. Sword Health ($2B valuation) focuses on employer chronic pain at $150/month - too expensive for seniors.

Our unfair advantage: proprietary dataset of 100,000+ senior movement patterns from our pilot, making our AI uniquely accurate for this population. Competitors trained on younger adults can't safely adapt exercises for joint replacements, osteoporosis, or neuropathy.

Defensibility comes from network effects - each user improves the AI. Our Medicare Advantage distribution partnerships take 18-month sales cycles, creating barriers. Users invest time teaching the system their limitations, creating 73% retention after year one.

Speed advantage: While competitors focus on employer sales, we're capturing the direct-to-consumer senior market. Bold took 3 years to reach 50K users; our Medicare partnership pipeline could deliver that in 6 months.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**FDA regulation**: Digital fitness apps currently exempt, but FDA could classify AI-powered movement analysis as medical device. Mitigation: Staying under "wellness" classification by avoiding medical claims, building relationship with FDA, preparing 510(k) pathway if needed.

**Tech adoption barriers**: Some seniors struggle with app setup. Mitigation: Onboarding success rate improved from 62% to 91% with our "grandchild setup" feature - one-click sharing for remote assistance.

**Apple/Google entry**: Big tech could add senior fitness features. Mitigation: Our medical-grade movement library and Medicare distribution create switching costs. Apple targets general wellness, not medical conditions.

Why hasn't Peloton done this? Their $3,000 hardware + subscription model doesn't work for fixed-income seniors. Their brand represents intensity, not accessibility.

## Milestones

**30 days**: 500 beta users through senior center partnerships
**90 days**: 2,000 MAU with 70% week-2 retention
**6 months**: $50K MRR, first Medicare Advantage pilot
**12 months**: $200K MRR, 10K users, Series A metrics achieved
