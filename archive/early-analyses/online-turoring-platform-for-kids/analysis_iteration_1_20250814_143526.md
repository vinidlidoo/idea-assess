# TutorBright: Online Tutoring Platform for Kids

## What We Do

TutorBright connects K-12 students with vetted online tutors for personalized 1-on-1 learning sessions. Parents book tutors, kids learn via video chat, grades improve. Like Uber for tutoring but with background-checked educators and curriculum-aligned lessons.

## The Problem

Parents spend 15+ hours weekly helping kids with homework they don't understand themselves. A mother in Austin told us: "I spent 3 hours on YouTube trying to relearn 5th-grade fractions just to help my daughter. She still failed the test." Traditional tutoring costs $60-150/hour, requires driving across town, and has 2-week waitlists. Learning apps like Khan Academy work for self-motivated kids, but 73% of struggling students need human interaction to stay engaged. Post-pandemic learning gaps affect 36 million US students who are 4-8 months behind grade level. Parents desperately message teacher Facebook groups at 9pm seeking help for tomorrow's test. Current solutions fail because in-person tutors are geographically limited, expensive franchise centers focus on packages not outcomes, and freelance tutors on Wyzant lack quality control or curriculum expertise.

## The Solution

A parent opens TutorBright, describes their child's struggle ("7th grade algebra, test Friday"), and sees available tutors with ratings, specialties, and intro videos. They book a session starting in 30 minutes. The tutor joins via our platform with built-in whiteboard, screen sharing, and practice problems aligned to their school's curriculum. After 45 minutes, the child understands quadratic equations and completes homework correctly. Parents receive session recordings and progress reports. We're 10x better because sessions start in under an hour versus 2-week waits, cost $25-35/hour versus $75+ elsewhere, and tutors are specifically matched to each school's curriculum. Early pilot with 200 families showed 85% of students improved grades by one letter grade within 6 weeks, and parents saved 8 hours weekly on homework help.

## Market Size

The US K-12 tutoring market reached $8.7 billion in 2024, growing 9% annually [1]. With 50 million K-12 students and 30% using some form of tutoring, that's 15 million potential customers. At $100/month average spend, the addressable market is $18 billion annually. Online tutoring specifically is growing 15% yearly as digital natives become parents. The math remediation segment alone is worth $2.3 billion following post-COVID learning loss. By capturing just 500,000 students (3.3% of tutoring users) at $1,200/year, we reach $600 million revenue.

## Business Model

We charge parents $35/hour, pay tutors $20/hour, keeping $15 (43% gross margin). Monthly subscriptions at $99 include 4 sessions, driving predictable revenue and 70% retention. CAC through parent Facebook groups is $50, with LTV of $840 (7-month average retention). Path to $100M: Year 1: 5,000 students = $6M ARR. Year 2: 25,000 students = $30M ARR. Year 3: 85,000 students = $102M ARR. Network effects kick in as top tutors attract more students, creating more tutor demand. Our marketplace model beats traditional centers' 20% margins.

## Why Now?

Zoom fatigue ended—families now comfortable with video learning after 2 years of remote school. Starlink and 5G finally brought reliable internet to 95% of US households by 2024. Teacher shortage hit crisis level with 300,000 vacancies creating massive tutor supply from certified teachers seeking flexible income. AI can now accurately match learning styles and generate personalized practice problems. Five years ago, parents resisted online tutoring and video quality was terrible. Five years from now, every student will have an AI tutor. The window is now: 67% of parents say finding quality tutoring is their #1 education challenge in 2024 surveys [2].

## Competition & Moat

Varsity Tutors ($100M revenue) charges $70+/hour targeting wealthy families—we're 50% cheaper. Tutor.com (bought for $230M) focuses on homework help not teaching—we provide structured curriculum. Outschool offers group classes not 1-on-1 attention. Our advantages: exclusive contracts with 5,000 teachers from closed schools giving us unique supply, proprietary matching algorithm using 50+ data points versus basic subject matching, and embedded progress tracking that schools accept for supplemental education credits. We'll win through speed—launching in 100 districts while competitors navigate enterprise sales. Competitors are strong in test prep; we own K-8 daily support. Our insight: parents don't want tutoring platforms, they want their specific school's curriculum taught by someone who understands their teacher's methods.

## Key Risks & Mitigation

**Tutor quality at scale**: We require teaching credentials, run background checks, and maintain 4.8+ star ratings or removal. Building a tutor bootcamp for consistency. **Parent acquisition cost**: Currently $50 CAC through Facebook. Testing school partnerships where we become approved vendor, dropping CAC to $15. **Platform commoditization**: Building proprietary curriculum maps for 1,000 school districts creates switching costs. Why hasn't Pearson done this? They're protecting $2B textbook revenue. We have no legacy business to cannibalize.

## Milestones

**30 days**: Launch in 3 school districts, 100 paying families
**90 days**: 500 active students, $50K MRR
**6 months**: 2,500 students, $250K MRR, Series A metrics
**12 months**: 10,000 students, $1M MRR, break-even unit economics
