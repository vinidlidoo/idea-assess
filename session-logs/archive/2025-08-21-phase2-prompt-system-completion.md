# Session Log: Phase 2 Prompt System Completion

**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Claude Code Session ID**: 7ea87e2b-6d2b-4b7a-a3ae-8fa74d391b59  
**Start Time**: 11:30 PDT  
**End Time**: 12:58 PDT  
**Status**: Completed  
**Commits**: End of session (to be created)

## Session Goals

1. ✅ Complete the simplified prompt loading system from v4 design
2. ✅ Fix remaining issues in test script and pipeline
3. ✅ Create comprehensive system architecture documentation
4. ✅ Address final code cleanup items

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Simplified Prompt System Implementation

- **What**: Completed the prompt loading simplification per v4 design
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added `system_prompt` field to BaseAgentConfig (default: "system.md")
  - Removed all override complexity - direct config modification pattern
  - Simplified `get_system_prompt_path()` to handle only basic paths
  - Updated CLI to directly modify `config.system_prompt`
- **Result**: Clean, understandable prompt loading without complex overrides

### 2. Pipeline Fixes

- **Issue**: max_iterations should depend on pipeline mode
- **Solution**: Set max_iterations to 1 for ANALYZE mode, use reviewer config for other modes
- **Impact**: Correct behavior for analyst-only runs

### 3. System Architecture Documentation

- **Created**: Comprehensive `system-architecture.md` (770+ lines)
- **Contents**:
  - Complete architecture overview with principles
  - Detailed component documentation
  - Agent system hierarchy and responsibilities
  - Pipeline flow and state management
  - Configuration and context systems
  - Extension points for Phase 3/4
  - Design decisions and rationale
- **Purpose**: Primary reference for future development sessions

### 4. Minor Fixes

- **Test Script**: Updated scenario to use proper prompt path format
- **Config**: Increased max_turns from 10 to 20 in BaseAgentConfig
- **Reviewer Instructions**: Clarified that feedback file must be read before editing

## Technical Decisions

### Direct Configuration Pattern

- **Decision**: No override systems, just direct field modification
- **Rationale**: Explicit state is easier to debug and understand
- **Implementation**: `analyst_config.system_prompt = "experimental/analyst/concise.md"`

### Prompt Path Resolution

- **Simple Rule**: If no "/" in prompt name, look in `agents/{agent_type}/`
- **With Path**: Use as-is from prompts_dir
- **Example**: "system.md" → "agents/analyst/system.md"

### Max Iterations Logic

- **ANALYZE mode**: Always 1 iteration (no review)
- **Other modes**: Use reviewer's configured max_iterations
- **Implementation**: Conditional in pipeline **init**

## Code Quality Metrics

### Phase 2 Final State

- **Core System**: ~500 lines (config, contexts, results, agent_base)
- **Pipeline**: 302 lines (clean, pattern-matched)
- **Agents**: ~400 lines total (analyst + reviewer)
- **Utils**: Reduced by 75% in previous session
- **Overall**: Clean, maintainable, extensible

### Type Safety

- ✅ No type errors (basedpyright clean)
- ✅ No linting issues (ruff clean)
- ✅ Proper generics usage

## Issues Resolved

1. ✅ Simplified prompt loading to remove complexity
2. ✅ Fixed max_iterations to depend on pipeline mode
3. ✅ Documented entire architecture comprehensively
4. ✅ Fixed markdown linting in all documentation

## Handoff Notes for Next Session

### Priority: Testing Phase

The codebase is now clean and stable. Next session should focus on:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test config creation and modification
   - Test context initialization
   - Test result pattern matching
   - Test prompt path resolution

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end pipeline tests
   - Mock Claude SDK responses
   - Test iteration flows
   - Verify file creation patterns

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Aim for 80%+ coverage on core modules
   - Focus on critical paths first
   - Use pytest with async support

### Current State Summary

- Phase 2 implementation is COMPLETE
- Architecture is clean and well-documented
- All v4 design goals achieved
- Ready for comprehensive testing

## Session Reflection

### What Went Well

- Completed all remaining Phase 2 simplification tasks
- Created excellent documentation for future reference
- Maintained clean code throughout
- Fixed all type and linting issues immediately

### Challenges Faced

- Initial confusion about prompt override pattern (resolved by adhering to v4 design)
- Minor type annotation issues (all resolved)

### Key Insights

- Direct configuration is much cleaner than override patterns
- Comprehensive documentation created during refactoring is invaluable
- The v4 design has proven to be the right approach

## Files Changed

### Modified

- `src/core/config.py` - Added system_prompt field
- `src/core/contexts.py` - Removed unused system_prompt from context
- `src/core/agent_base.py` - Simplified prompt loading
- `src/core/pipeline.py` - Fixed max_iterations logic
- `src/cli.py` - Direct config modification
- `src/agents/analyst.py` - Removed context parameter from load_system_prompt
- `src/agents/reviewer.py` - Removed context parameter from load_system_prompt
- `test_locally.sh` - Updated test scenarios
- `config/prompts/agents/reviewer/user/review.md` - Maintained correct instructions

### Created

- `system-architecture.md` - Comprehensive system documentation

### Archived

- Multiple old analyses and test files (git status shows deletions)

## Next Session Planning

**Focus**: Unit and Integration Testing
**Priority Tasks**:

1. Set up pytest infrastructure
2. Create unit tests for all core modules
3. Create integration tests for pipeline flows
4. Mock Claude SDK for deterministic tests
5. Achieve 80%+ test coverage

**Time Estimate**: 4-6 hours for comprehensive test suite
