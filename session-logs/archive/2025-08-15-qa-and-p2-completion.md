## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: c043fd47-6deb-41cb-a827-f5905d7e7f32
**Start Time:** 2025-08-15 10:30 PDT  
**End Time:** 2025-08-15 11:34 PDT  
**Previous Session:** 2025-08-15-p2-documentation-refactoring-testing.md  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [ ] Q&A session about codebase and design decisions (from previous handoff)
- [ ] Break up god method (run_analyst_reviewer_loop ~200 lines)
- [ ] Add JSON schema validation for reviewer feedback
- [ ] Discuss Path objects refactor need before implementing
- [ ] Run Level 2 tests with reviewer functionality (if time permits)

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Task:** Fixed reviewer tests hanging issue
  - Files: `src/core/pipeline.py`, `config/prompts/agents/analyst/revision.md`
  - Outcome: Tests now run successfully - was looking for wrong prompt filename
  - Commit: end of session

- **Task:** Improved test script
  - Files: `test_locally.sh`
  - Outcome: Added Ctrl+C handling, reordered tests to start with debug
  - Commit: end of session

- **Task:** Implemented clean file organization for analyses
  - Files: `src/utils/archive_manager.py`, `src/utils/cleanup_manager.py`, `analyses/README.md`
  - Outcome: Cleaner structure with archiving, removed timestamped clutter
  - Commit: end of session

- **Task:** Designed improved logging system
  - Files: `src/utils/improved_logging.py`, `logs/README.md`
  - Outcome: Better organized logs with human-readable summaries
  - Commit: end of session (to be integrated next session)

## Next Session Priority

1. **Must Do:** Implement and integrate the improved logging system (StructuredLogger)
2. **Should Do:** Break up the god method (run_analyst_reviewer_loop) - it's 200+ lines
3. **Could Do:** Add JSON schema validation for reviewer feedback

## Open Questions

Questions that arose during this session:

- Should we use Path objects throughout the codebase? (deferred discussion)
- How to handle the reviewer creating duplicate files in different locations?
- Should test logs be integrated into the new logging structure?

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- Current state: File organization working, tests passing, logging system designed but not integrated
- Next immediate action: Integrate StructuredLogger into pipeline, replace old debug_logging
- Watch out for: Context window getting large - may need to start fresh session

## Session Metrics (Optional)

- Lines of code: +X/-Y
- Files touched: N
- Test coverage: X%
- Session duration: ~X hours
