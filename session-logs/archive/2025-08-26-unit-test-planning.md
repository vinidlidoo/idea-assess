# Session Log: 2025-08-26 - Unit Test Planning & Improvements

## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: 3d7bcdae-364a-49e9-9fec-80034b7539bb
**Start Time:** 2025-08-26 15:12 PDT
**End Time:** [In Progress]
**Previous Session:** 2025-08-26-tool-improvements-implementation.md

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [x] Analyze existing unit test coverage and identify gaps
- [x] Create comprehensive testing plan with prioritized missing test cases
- [x] Identify improvements to existing test patterns and structure

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Task:** Unit test coverage analysis
  - Files examined: All modules in `src/` and `tests/unit/`
  - Created comprehensive test plan: `2025-08-26-unit-test-plan.md`
  - Identified ~50 missing test cases across 7 untested modules

## Session Plan

I'll now examine the codebase and create a comprehensive unit testing plan document that:

1. **Lists missing test cases** by priority (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
2. **Identifies improvements** to existing tests
3. **Focuses on tests/unit/** directory

The plan will cover:

- Untested utility modules
- Missing edge cases in existing tests
- Integration points that need coverage
- Error scenarios not currently tested

## Handoff Notes

Current state:

- Reading through codebase to identify testing gaps
- Will create unit-test-plan.md document with prioritized test cases
