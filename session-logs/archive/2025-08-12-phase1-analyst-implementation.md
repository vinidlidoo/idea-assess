# Session Log: 2025-08-12 - Phase 1 Analyst Implementation

## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: f8ac003d-8722-4aaa-9d0e-dde83039c4b7
**Start Time:** 2025-08-12 15:35 PDT  
**End Time:** 2025-08-12 17:16 PDT  
**Previous Session:** 2025-08-12-implementation-foundation.md  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [x] Create analyze.py with basic Analyst agent using claude-code-sdk
- [x] Implement minimal CLI with argparse for `analyze "<idea>"` command
- [~] Test with first 5 ideas from test_ideas.txt (partial - hit timeout issues)
- [x] Create proper directory structure for outputs (analyses/, ideas/)
- [ ] Iterate on analyst_v1.md prompt based on initial results

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Task:** Set up Python project with uv package manager
  - Files: `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `.env.example`
  - Outcome: Clean project structure with src/ folder
  - Commit: uncommitted

- **Task:** Installed claude-code-sdk and dependencies
  - Files: Virtual environment in .venv/
  - Outcome: SDK works, uses Claude Code CLI authentication
  - Note: No API key needed when logged into Claude Code CLI

- **Task:** Created multiple analyzer implementations
  - Files: `src/analyze.py`, `src/analyze_client.py`, `src/analyze_debug.py`
  - Outcome: Basic structure works but WebSearch causes timeouts
  - Issue: Consistent 1-minute timeout when using WebSearch tool

### In Progress

- **Task:** Debugging WebSearch timeout issue
  - Status: Identified 1-minute timeout pattern
  - Blockers: WebSearch tool hangs after tool call

### Decisions Made

- **Decision:** Use `uv` as Python package manager
  - Alternatives considered: pip, poetry
  - Why chosen: User preference, modern and fast

- **Decision:** Use Claude Code CLI auth instead of API key
  - Alternatives considered: Separate API key from console
  - Why chosen: Works without additional setup, uses Max subscription

## Code Changes

### Created

Main files:

- `src/analyze.py` - Initial implementation using query()
- `src/analyze_client.py` - Implementation using ClaudeSDKClient
- `src/analyze_debug.py` - Debug version with JSON logging
- `config/prompts/analyst_v1_simple.md` - Simplified 500-word prompt

Test files (for debugging):

- `src/test_simple.py` - Simple haiku test (works!)
- `src/test_websearch.py` - WebSearch test (works for simple queries)
- `src/test_client_simple.py` - Client test without tools (works!)
- `src/test_client_websearch.py` - Client with WebSearch (works for simple!)
- `src/test_analyst_simple.py` - Test with simplified prompt (times out)
- `src/test_no_system.py` - Test without system prompt (times out)

### Modified

- `CLAUDE.md` - Added uv and API key info
- `requirements.txt` - Fixed claude-code-sdk version to 0.0.19
- `.gitignore` - Added Python and project-specific patterns

### Deleted

None

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: WebSearch Tool Timeout

- **Issue:** Consistent 1-minute timeout when using WebSearch with complex prompts
- **Observations:**
  - Simple queries work fine (e.g., "search for one fact")
  - Complex analyst prompts cause hanging after WebSearch tool call
  - Timeout is exactly 1 minute every time
- **Attempted Solutions:**
  - Tried both query() and ClaudeSDKClient approaches
  - Simplified prompts (analyst_v1_simple.md)
  - Increased max_thinking_tokens to 20000
  - Added debug logging to understand message flow
- **Status:** Unresolved - needs investigation in next session

## Testing Status

- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing notes:

## Tools & Resources

- **MCP Tools Used:** [To be filled]
- **External Docs:** [To be filled]
- **AI Agents:** [To be filled]

## Next Session Priority

1. **Must Do:** Clean up test files and resolve WebSearch timeout issue
2. **Should Do:** Get one complete analysis working end-to-end
3. **Could Do:** Test with remaining 4 ideas from test_ideas.txt

## Open Questions

Questions that arose during this session:

- Why does WebSearch cause exactly 1-minute timeouts with complex prompts?
- Is there a timeout setting in Claude Code CLI we're missing?
- Should we try a different approach (e.g., direct API instead of SDK)?

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- **Current state:** Basic infrastructure complete but WebSearch integration broken
- **Working files:**
  - `src/analyze_client.py` - Most complete implementation
  - `src/test_client_websearch.py` - Shows WebSearch works for simple queries
- **Next immediate action:**
  1. Delete all test_*.py files in src/ to clean up
  2. Focus on fixing the WebSearch timeout in analyze_client.py
  3. Consider alternative: Remove WebSearch temporarily to get v1 working
- **Watch out for:**
  - The 1-minute timeout is very consistent - likely a default setting somewhere
  - Simple WebSearch queries work, complex ones hang
  - May need to break down the analysis into smaller sequential queries

## Session Metrics

- Files created: 15 (6 main, 6 test, 3 config/docs)
- Files modified: 4
- Lines of code: ~800+
- Test coverage: N/A (Phase 1)
