# Session Log: 2025-08-19 - Pipeline Refactoring Critical Fixes

## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: Current Session
**Start Time:** 2025-08-19 20:41 PDT  
**End Time:** [Fill at session end]  
**Previous Session:** 2025-08-19-permission-mode-pipeline-refactor.md  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [ ] Fix critical iteration logic problem (max_iterations semantics)
- [ ] Fix iteration numbering confusion (0-based vs 1-based)
- [ ] Add type safety with TypedDicts for feedback
- [ ] Extract complex methods from run_analyst_reviewer_loop
- [ ] Centralize file management with IterationFileManager

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Task:** Session log created
  - Files: `session-logs/2025-08-19-pipeline-refactoring-critical-fixes.md`
  - Outcome: Session initialized with clear objectives from pipeline-improvements.md
  - Commit: uncommitted

### In Progress

- **Task:** Analyzing pipeline.py for refactoring
  - Status: Initial analysis complete
  - Blockers: None

### Decisions Made

- **Decision:** Focus on critical business logic issues first
  - Alternatives considered: Starting with code quality improvements
  - Why chosen: Business logic bugs directly impact system functionality

## Next Session Priority

1. **Must Do:** Test the refactored pipeline with real ideas
2. **Should Do:** Add comprehensive unit tests for new components
3. **Could Do:** Performance optimizations

## Open Questions

Questions that arose during this session:

- Should we rename max_iterations to max_revisions for clarity?
- How should we handle partial failures in the pipeline?

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- Current state: Pipeline analysis complete, ready to implement fixes
- Next immediate action: Start with iteration logic fix
- Watch out for: Existing tests that may depend on current behavior

## Session Metrics (Optional)
