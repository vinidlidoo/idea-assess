# Session Log: 2025-08-13 - Prompt Iteration for Improved Analysis Quality

## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: 7b664aac-8d86-4eee-982b-d53a3218aa27
**Start Time:** 2025-08-13 15:04 PDT  
**End Time:** 2025-08-13 16:38 PDT  
**Previous Session:** 2025-08-13-code-quality-improvements.md  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [x] Iterate on analyst_v1.md prompt to improve output quality
- [x] Test with diverse ideas to identify weaknesses  
- [x] Ensure analyses are specific and actionable
- [ ] Fix interrupt handling exit code -2 issue (deferred)

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Task:** Created comprehensive improvement areas document
  - Files: `config/prompts/improvement-areas.md`
  - Outcome: Documented 7 key areas needing improvement in v1 analyses
  
- **Task:** Created analyst_v2.md with major enhancements
  - Files: `config/prompts/analyst_v2.md`
  - Outcome: New prompt with emphasis on 2024-2025 data, specific metrics, references
  
- **Task:** Updated analyze.py to support v2 and pass resource constraints
  - Files: `src/analyze.py`
  - Outcome: v2 now default, constraints passed to agent, word count added
  
- **Task:** Tested v2 prompt with multiple ideas
  - Files: Multiple analysis files generated
  - Outcome: Significant quality improvements validated

### Decisions Made

- **Decision:** Make v2 the default prompt version
  - Alternatives considered: Keep v1 as default
  - Why chosen: v2 significantly better quality, v1 still accessible via flag
  
- **Decision:** Add references section with 150-200 extra words
  - Alternatives considered: Inline citations only, defer to later
  - Why chosen: Adds credibility immediately without waiting for Phase 2

## Code Changes

### Created

- `config/prompts/improvement-areas.md` - Document tracking areas for improvement
- `config/prompts/analyst_v2.md` - Enhanced analyst prompt with specific improvements

### Modified

- `src/analyze.py` - Added v2 support, resource constraints, word count display

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Agent tried to use file tools instead of generating text

- **Issue:** v2 agent attempted Write/Read operations, used 35 messages vs 15 limit
- **Solution:** Added explicit instruction to NOT use file tools in v2 prompt
- **Learning:** Be very explicit about output format expectations

## Testing Status

- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing notes:

## Tools & Resources

- **MCP Tools Used:** [e.g., web search, context7]
- **External Docs:** [URLs or references]
- **AI Agents:** [Which agents/prompts worked well]

## Next Session Priority

1. **Must Do:** Begin Phase 2 - Add Reviewer agent for feedback loop
2. **Should Do:** Investigate max_turns limit not being enforced (SDK issue?)
3. **Could Do:** Fix interrupt handling exit code -2 issue

## Open Questions

- Why doesn't max_turns=15 actually limit to 15 messages?
- Should we report the SDK max_turns issue?
- Add batch processing capability for multiple ideas?

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- Current state: v2 analyst prompt complete and producing high-quality analyses
- Next immediate action: Refactor analyze.py per TODO.md - add capability to process list of ideas from text file
- Alternative priority: Begin Phase 2 - Create Reviewer agent for feedback loop
- Watch out for: Ensure any new agents don't use file tools either; max_turns limit may not work as expected

## Session Metrics

- Files created: 2
- Files modified: 1
- Test analyses run: 3
- v2 improvements validated: 7 key areas addressed
