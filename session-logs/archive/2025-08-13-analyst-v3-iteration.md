**Previous Session:** 2025-08-13-prompt-iteration.md  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [x] Review analyst v2 prompt and identify areas for v3 improvements
- [x] Create analyst v3 prompt based on user's ideas
- [x] Test v3 with at least one business idea
- [x] Update analyze.py to support v3

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Task:** Created analyst v3 prompt with YC-inspired style
  - Files: `config/prompts/analyst_v3.md`
  - Outcome: Sharp, direct analysis focused on why this will be massive
  - Commit: uncommitted

- **Task:** Updated analyze.py to support v3
  - Files: `src/analyze.py`
  - Outcome: v3 now available and set as default
  - Commit: uncommitted

- **Task:** Tested v3 with cannabis retail idea
  - Files: `analyses/us-based-cannabis-retailer-with-japanese-level-hig/analysis_20250813_180715.md`
  - Outcome: Excellent results - compelling, data-driven, YC-style pitch

### Decisions Made

- **Decision:** Maintain references section from v2
  - Alternatives considered: Remove citations for maximum brevity
  - Why chosen: Credibility matters, especially with bold claims

## Code Changes

### Created

- `config/prompts/analyst_v3.md` - YC-inspired direct analysis prompt
- `config/prompts/analyst_v3_idea.md` - User's inspiration document

### Modified

- `src/analyze.py` - Added v3 to choices, made it default prompt version

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Initial v3 missing references

- **Issue:** First version of v3 removed references section
- **Solution:** Added back references with inline citations
- **Learning:** Balance brevity with credibility - references are worth the extra words

## Testing Status

- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing notes:

## Tools & Resources

- **MCP Tools Used:** [e.g., web search, context7]
- **External Docs:** [URLs or references]
- **AI Agents:** [Which agents/prompts worked well]

## Next Session Priority

1. **Must Do:** Begin Phase 2 - Add Reviewer agent for feedback loop
2. **Should Do:** Test v3 with more diverse ideas to validate consistency
3. **Could Do:** Refactor analyze.py to support batch processing (from TODO.md)

## Open Questions

Questions that arose during this session:

- Question needing research or decision
- Uncertainty to resolve

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- Current state: v3 analyst prompt complete and producing YC-style analyses
- Next immediate action: Create Reviewer agent that can provide feedback on v3 outputs
- Watch out for: Ensure Reviewer understands v3's direct style and doesn't push back to MBA-speak

## Key v3 Improvements from v2

1. **Brevity**: 900 words vs 1000+, every sentence earns its place
2. **YC-style sections**: "What We Do", "Why Now?", focus on 10x
3. **Direct language**: No corporate speak, write like explaining to smart friend
4. **Killer metrics**: "Holy shit" stats that grab attention
5. **Clear path to $100M**: Venture-scale thinking throughout
6. **Concrete milestones**: 30/90 day/6mo/12mo targets
7. **Maintained rigor**: Kept references and citations for credibility

## Session Metrics

- Lines of code: +145 (new prompt)
- Files touched: 3
- Analyses generated: 1 (cannabis retail)
