# Session Log: 2025-01-08 - Project Organization & Session Logging Setup

## Session Context

**Start Time:** 2025-08-08 09:40 PDT  
**End Time:** 2025-08-08 10:10 PDT  
**Previous Session:** N/A (First logged session)  
**Claude Model:** Claude Code Opus 4.1

## Objectives

- [x] Archive old planning documents
- [x] Set up session logging workflow
- [x] Create reusable session template
- [x] Create project-level slash commands for session management
- [x] Define context separation between CLAUDE.md and session logs

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Archived Initial Planning Docs:** Moved outdated files to organized archive
  - Files: `starter-convo-transcript.txt`, `starter-qa.md`, `work-plan.md`
  - Outcome: Cleaner project root, files preserved in `archive/initial-planning/`
  - Commit: end of session

- **Established Session Logging System:** Created template-based logging
  - Files: `session-logs/SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`
  - Outcome: Standardized format for tracking progress
  - Commit: end of session

- **Created Project-level Slash Commands:** Built workflow automation
  - Files: `.claude/commands/start-project-session.md`, `.claude/commands/close-project-session.md`
  - Outcome: Automated session start/end workflow with context loading and documentation
  - Commit: end of session

- **Refined Context Separation Strategy:** CLAUDE.md vs session logs
  - Modified: `CLAUDE.md` - Restructured for stable context only
  - Outcome: Clear delineation between stable project context and detailed session history
  - Commit: end of session

### In Progress

- **Technical Design Phase:** Next major milestone per CLAUDE.md
  - Status: Not started
  - Blockers: None

### Decisions Made

- **No README in archive:** Keep archive self-explanatory
  - Alternatives considered: README with metadata, .gitignore entry
  - Why chosen: Simplicity, may remove from repo later

- **Session log structure:** Comprehensive template with clear sections
  - Alternatives considered: Simple bullet list, automated git-based logging
  - Why chosen: Balance of detail and ease of use

- **Project-level slash commands:** Created `.claude/commands/` for session workflow
  - Alternatives considered: Global commands in `~/.claude/`
  - Why chosen: Project-specific workflow, portable with repo

- **Context separation:** CLAUDE.md for stable context, session logs for detailed history
  - Alternatives considered: Everything in CLAUDE.md, separate docs folder
  - Why chosen: Minimize context pollution, clear separation of concerns

## Code Changes

### Created

- `session-logs/SESSION_TEMPLATE.md` - Reusable template for session tracking
- `session-logs/2025-01-08-archiving-and-setup.md` - This session log
- `.claude/commands/start-project-session.md` - Slash command to start sessions
- `.claude/commands/close-project-session.md` - Slash command to close sessions
- `archive/initial-planning/` - Directory for archived documents

### Modified

- `CLAUDE.md` - Restructured to contain only stable context, added session workflow section

### Moved (to archive)

- `starter-convo-transcript.txt` → `archive/initial-planning/`
- `starter-qa.md` → `archive/initial-planning/`
- `work-plan.md` → `archive/initial-planning/`

## Problems & Solutions

None encountered.

## Testing Status

N/A - No code implementation yet

## Tools & Resources

- **MCP Tools Used:** None
- **External Docs:** None
- **AI Agents:** N/A

## Next Session Priority

1. **Must Do:** Research Claude SDK capabilities (per CLAUDE.md)
   - Agent patterns and sub-agents
   - MCP protocol integration
   - Review latest Anthropic docs

2. **Should Do:** Begin agent architecture design
   - Define interfaces
   - Draft initial prompts

3. **Could Do:** Set up project structure for implementation

## Open Questions

From CLAUDE.md design phase questions:

- How to structure agent prompts for consistency?
- Best approach for web search via MCP?
- How to handle partial failures in pipeline?
- Optimal checkpoint/resume implementation?

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- Current state: Requirements complete, ready for technical design
- Next immediate action: Research Claude SDK docs and capabilities
- Watch out for: 10-day implementation timeline starting soon

## Session Metrics (Optional)

- Lines of code: ~200 (markdown/config)
- Files touched: 5 created, 3 moved, 1 modified
- Test coverage: N/A
- Tokens used: ~15000
