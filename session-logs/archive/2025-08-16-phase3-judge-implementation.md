  - Commit: end of session

### In Progress

None - all refactoring work completed

### Decisions Made

- **Decision:** Eliminate ProcessedMessage abstraction entirely
  - Alternatives considered: Keep ProcessedMessage, add more type annotations
  - Why chosen: Preserves SDK type information, simpler architecture, better type safety

- **Decision:** Convert MessageProcessor to stateful tracker instead of transformer
  - Alternatives considered: Keep process_message() method with better types
  - Why chosen: Clearer separation of concerns, explicit tracking vs extraction

## Code Changes

### Created

- `tests/unit/test_message_processor.py` - Unit tests for MessageProcessor SDK type handling

### Modified

- `src/core/message_processor.py` - Removed all try/except blocks and protocol fallbacks, now uses SDK types directly
  - Simplified `extract_session_id()` - no more regex or protocol fallback
  - Simplified `process_message()` - direct SDK type checking
  - Simplified `_extract_content()` - no more fallback to ContentBlock protocol
  - Removed unused imports

### Deleted

- Removed ContentBlock protocol import - no longer needed

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1

- **Issue:** Description
- **Solution:** How resolved
- **Learning:** Key takeaway

## Testing Status

- [x] Unit tests pass (9/9 MessageProcessor tests passing)
- [ ] Integration tests pass (not run this session)
- [x] Type checking: 0 errors, minimal warnings (only unavoidable Any types)

## Tools & Resources

- **MCP Tools Used:** [e.g., web search, context7]
- **External Docs:** [URLs or references]
- **AI Agents:** [Which agents/prompts worked well]

## Next Session Priority

1. **Must Do:** Continue code quality inspection and Q&A
2. **Should Do:** Begin Phase 3 Judge agent implementation if time allows
3. **Could Do:** Additional refactoring opportunities found during inspection

## Open Questions

Questions that arose during this session:

- Question needing research or decision
- Uncertainty to resolve

## Refactoring Completed: message_processor.py

### Goal

✅ COMPLETED: Simplified MessageProcessor to use SDK types directly instead of duck typing and custom protocols.

### Steps (in order)

1. **Import SDK types**
   - Add imports for UserMessage, AssistantMessage, SystemMessage, ResultMessage
   - Add imports for TextBlock, ToolUseBlock, ToolResultBlock
   - Keep Protocol imports for now as fallback

2. **Fix extract_session_id (lines 70-77)**
   - Change to: `if isinstance(message, SystemMessage): return message.data.get("session_id")`
   - Remove regex parsing

3. **Fix process_message type checks (lines 105-119)**
   - Replace duck typing with isinstance checks
   - Use direct attribute access instead of getattr/hasattr

4. **Fix _extract_content (lines 150-191)**
   - Replace ContentBlock protocol with specific SDK block types
   - Use isinstance(block, ToolUseBlock/TextBlock/ToolResultBlock)
   - Access attributes directly (block.text, block.name, etc.)

5. **Run type checker after each change**
   - `basedpyright src/core/message_processor.py`
   - Ensure no new warnings

6. **Test with existing analyses**
   - Run `test_locally.sh` to verify functionality
   - Check that message processing still works

### Risks to Watch

- Protocol fallbacks might still be needed for compatibility
- Need to preserve existing behavior exactly
- Must maintain type safety (no new warnings)

## Major Refactoring Plan: Eliminate ProcessedMessage

### Problem Statement

We're unnecessarily flattening well-structured SDK `Message` types into a custom `ProcessedMessage` class, losing type safety and creating redundant abstractions.

### Current Flow

1. SDK Message → MessageProcessor.process_message() → ProcessedMessage
2. ProcessedMessage gets passed around with flattened content
3. Lost all type information and structure from SDK

### Proposed New Architecture

#### 1. Eliminate ProcessedMessage class

- Remove `ProcessedMessage` dataclass entirely
- Remove `MessageMetadata` TypedDict (redundant)

#### 2. Refactor MessageProcessor Role

MessageProcessor should become a stateful tracker/helper, not a message transformer:

```python
class MessageProcessor:
    """Tracks message statistics and helps extract content."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.message_count = 0
        self.search_count = 0
        self.result_buffer = []
        
    def track_message(self, message: Message) -> None:
        """Update internal counters based on message."""
        
    def extract_content(self, message: Message) -> list[str]:
        """Extract text content from a message."""
        
    def extract_search_queries(self, message: Message) -> list[str]:
        """Extract search queries from a message."""
        
    def get_session_id(self, message: Message) -> str | None:
        """Extract session ID from SystemMessage."""
```

#### 3. Update Call Sites

Find all uses of `ProcessedMessage` and refactor to use SDK types directly:

**Before:**

```python
processed = processor.process_message(msg)
for content in processed.content:
    # do something
```

**After:**

```python
processor.track_message(msg)  # Update counters
content = processor.extract_content(msg)
for text in content:
    # do something
```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze Dependencies**
   - Search for all uses of `ProcessedMessage`
   - Search for all uses of `process_message()`
   - Identify which components actually need what data

2. **Create New MessageProcessor Interface**
   - Rename `process_message()` to `track_message()`
   - Split extraction logic into separate methods
   - Keep internal state management

3. **Update Pipeline/Agent Code**
   - Likely in `src/core/pipeline.py`
   - Possibly in agent implementations
   - Update to use SDK Message types directly

4. **Update Tests**
   - Rewrite `test_message_processor.py`
   - Test individual extraction methods
   - Verify tracking still works

5. **Clean Up**
   - Remove ProcessedMessage from types.py
   - Remove MessageMetadata
   - Update any imports

### Risks & Considerations

- **Breaking Change**: This will touch multiple files
- **Type Safety**: Need to ensure we handle all Message subtypes properly
- **State Management**: MessageProcessor becomes more explicitly stateful
- **Performance**: Might call extraction methods multiple times (can cache if needed)

### Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Preserve SDK type information throughout
- **Simpler**: Remove unnecessary abstraction layer
- **Aligned with SDK**: Use types as intended by the SDK
- **Clearer Intent**: MessageProcessor role becomes clearer

## Refactoring TODOs (Other Files)

Items identified during code review to refactor later:

- [x] Remove `to_dict()` method from `AgentResult` and use `dataclasses.asdict()` instead ✅ DONE
- [x] Remove empty `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block in `src/core/types.py` (lines 12-13) ✅ DONE

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- Current state: Major refactoring complete - MessageProcessor now uses SDK types directly
- Next immediate action: Continue code quality review and Q&A as requested by user
- Watch out for: All tests passing, excellent type safety achieved
