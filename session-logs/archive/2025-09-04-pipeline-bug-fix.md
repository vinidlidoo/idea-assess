# Session Log: 2025-09-04 - Critical Pipeline Bug Fix and Standardization

## Summary

Fixed critical bug where pipeline incorrectly continued to iteration 3 despite both reviewer and fact-checker approving iteration 2. Standardized field names across all agents and improved configuration consistency.

## Key Changes

### 1. Critical Bug Fix in Pipeline

**Issue**: Pipeline was checking wrong field name (`recommendation` instead of `iteration_recommendation`), causing it to incorrectly trigger additional iterations even when both agents approved.

**Fix in src/core/pipeline.py**:

```python
# Before (buggy):
recommendation = feedback.get("recommendation", "reject")

# After (fixed with backward compatibility):
recommendation = feedback.get("iteration_recommendation", feedback.get("recommendation", "reject"))
```

### 2. Field Name Standardization

Standardized all agents to use `iteration_recommendation` consistently:

- Updated reviewer agent templates
- Updated fact-checker templates
- Modified pipeline to check correct field
- Added fallback for backward compatibility

### 3. Configuration Consistency

Made `fact_checker_config` required like other configs:

```python
# Before:
fact_checker_config: FactCheckerConfig | None = None

# After:
fact_checker_config: FactCheckerConfig  # Required parameter
```

### 4. Debug Logging Improvements

Added debug logging to show decision values during pipeline execution:

```python
logger.debug(f"Reviewer recommendation value: '{recommendation}'")
logger.debug(f"FactChecker recommendation value: '{fc_recommendation}'")
logger.debug(f"Reviewer={recommendation}, FactChecker={fc_recommendation}")
```

## Test Updates

### Tests Fixed

- Updated pipeline tests to include required `fact_checker_config`
- Changed field names from `recommendation` to `iteration_recommendation`
- Added fact-checker template creation in tests
- Fixed 8 critical test failures

### Remaining Test Failures (21 total)

- 9 fact_checker tests (missing `load_prompt_with_includes`)
- 2 reviewer tests (JSON structure expectations)
- 2 config tests (expecting 3 configs but now return 4)
- 8 JSON validator tests (old field names and behavior)

**Decision**: Postponed fixing remaining tests to next session.

## Files Modified

1. **src/core/pipeline.py**
   - Fixed recommendation field checking bug
   - Made fact_checker_config required
   - Added debug logging

2. **tests/unit/test_core/test_pipeline.py**
   - Added fact_checker_config fixtures
   - Updated field names
   - Added template creation

3. **config/templates/agents/factchecker/fact-check.json**
   - Confirmed structure with `iteration_recommendation`

## Impact

- **Iteration Control**: Pipeline now correctly stops when both agents approve
- **Consistency**: All agents use same field naming convention
- **Debuggability**: Debug logs now clearly show decision values
- **Maintainability**: Required configs prevent None-checking complexity

## Next Session Tasks

1. Fix remaining 21 unit tests
2. Ask user for remaining tasks in this session

## Lessons Learned

- Field name consistency across agents is critical for pipeline logic
- Debug logging for decision points saves troubleshooting time
- Making configs consistently required reduces special-case code
