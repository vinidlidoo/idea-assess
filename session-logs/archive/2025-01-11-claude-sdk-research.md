# Session Log: 2025-01-11 - Claude SDK Research & Agent Architecture

## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: 47125923-5dc7-4a8f-a07e-d851eb5ea4f8
**Start Time:** 2025-08-11 10:05 PDT  
**End Time:** 2025-08-11 10:40 PDT  
**Previous Session:** `2025-01-08-archiving-and-setup.md`  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [x] Research Claude SDK capabilities for agent architecture
- [x] Review MCP protocol integration options
- [x] Research existing implementations to avoid reinventing the wheel
- [ ] Draft initial agent architecture design
- [ ] Create agent prompt templates

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Session Template Fix:** Updated template to prevent session ID errors
  - Files: `session-logs/SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`
  - Outcome: Clearer instructions to use current session ID
  - Commit: uncommitted

- **Comprehensive SDK Research:** Investigated existing solutions and tools
  - Files: `research/sdk-and-tools-research.md` (created)
  - Outcome: Clear recommendation to use Claude SDK + MCP, avoid unnecessary complexity
  - Commit: uncommitted

- **Key Findings:**
  - LangGraph/CrewAI offer advanced orchestration but add complexity
  - Claude SDK has native subagent support via Markdown files
  - MCP Python SDK 1.2.0+ with FastMCP simplifies tool creation
  - Can save 2-3 days by using existing tools vs custom implementation

### In Progress

- **Agent Architecture Design:** Ready to design based on research
  - Status: Research complete, design phase starting
  - Blockers: None

### Decisions Made

- **Technology Stack:** Claude SDK + MCP for external tools
  - Alternatives considered: LangGraph, CrewAI, pure custom implementation
  - Why chosen: Simplest for P0, native subagent support, saves 2-3 days, Anthropic-supported patterns

## Code Changes

### Created

- `research/sdk-and-tools-research.md` - Comprehensive research on existing tools and SDKs
- `design/agent-architecture.md` - Complete system architecture design
- `design/agent-interfaces.py` - Python interfaces for all agents
- `prompts/analyst.md` - System prompt for Analyst agent
- `prompts/reviewer.md` - System prompt for Reviewer agent  
- `prompts/judge.md` - System prompt for Judge agent
- `prompts/synthesizer.md` - System prompt for Synthesizer agent

### Modified

- `session-logs/SESSION_TEMPLATE.md` - Added clearer session ID instructions

## Problems & Solutions

None - Research and design phase went smoothly

## Testing Status

- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing notes:

## Tools & Resources

- **MCP Tools Used:** None yet
- **External Docs:** Anthropic Claude SDK docs, MCP documentation, LangGraph docs
- **Web Search:** Extensive research on existing implementations and patterns

## Next Session Priority

1. **Must Do:** Get user feedback and questions on the design
2. **Should Do:** Refine design based on feedback before implementation
3. **Could Do:** Start Python project structure only after design approval

## Open Questions

Questions resolved this session:

- ✅ How to structure agent prompts? → Markdown files with clear sections
- ✅ Best approach for web search? → MCP server pattern
- ✅ How to handle partial failures? → Checkpoint/resume with state files
- ✅ Technology choice? → Claude SDK + MCP

New questions:

- How to handle rate limiting for web searches?
- Best approach for testing agent prompts?

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- Current state: Research complete, architecture designed, prompts created, AWAITING USER REVIEW
- Next immediate action: Present design for user feedback and address questions
- Watch out for: 8 days remaining, but need design approval before implementation

## Session Metrics

- Lines of code: +1000 (mostly documentation/design)
- Files touched: 8 created, 1 modified
- Test coverage: N/A (design phase)
- Session duration: 35 minutes
