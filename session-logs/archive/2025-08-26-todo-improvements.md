# Session Log: 2025-08-26 - TODO Infrastructure and Feature Improvements

## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: Current session (will identify from latest timestamp)
**Start Time:** 2025-08-26 11:55 PDT  
**End Time:** [Fill at session end]  
**Previous Session:** 2025-08-26-template-implementation.md  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [x] Create implementation plan for analyst tool enhancements (WebFetch, TodoWrite, Thinking)
- [x] Iterate on plan based on user feedback (3 versions created)
- [ ] Implement the enhancements once plan is approved
- [ ] Test changes with test_locally.sh

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Task:** Created comprehensive implementation plan for analyst enhancements
  - Files: Created 3 versions of the plan in session-logs/
  - Outcome: v3 addresses all feedback with proper conditional logic
  - Key features: WebFetch, TodoWrite, and improved reasoning

- **Task:** Iterated based on extensive user feedback
  - v1: Initial plan with all three enhancements
  - v2: Simplified with consolidated tool instructions
  - v3: Final version with proper conditionals and CLI logic

### In Progress

- Awaiting approval to begin implementation

### Decisions Made

- **Decision:** Consolidate all tool instructions in renamed tools.md file
  - Alternatives considered: Separate files for each tool, embedded in system prompt
  - Why chosen: Cleaner organization, easier maintenance

- **Decision:** Make tool instructions conditional based on availability
  - Alternatives considered: Always show all instructions
  - Why chosen: Clearer guidance, avoids confusion about unavailable tools

- **Decision:** Keep TodoWrite available even when web tools disabled
  - Alternatives considered: Bundle all tools together
  - Why chosen: TodoWrite is useful for organization regardless of web access
