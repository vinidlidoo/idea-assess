# Session Log: 2025-08-12 - Implementation Foundation

## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: cb1da89f-26ad-47a7-a257-75b685c07508
**Start Time:** 2025-08-12 13:24 PDT  
**End Time:** 2025-08-12 14:00 PDT  
**Previous Session:** 2025-01-11-design-feedback-revision.md  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [x] Create a phased implementation plan with incremental milestones
- [x] Design Phase 1: Analyst-only prototype with test harness
- [x] Define validation criteria for each implementation phase
- [x] Document the gradual build approach (start small, test, iterate)

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Task:** Created phased implementation plan
  - Files: `implementation-plan.md`
  - Outcome: 5-phase incremental approach with clear validation criteria
  - Commit: end of session

- **Task:** Created test ideas list
  - Files: `test_ideas.txt`
  - Outcome: 15 diverse ideas for validation across all phases
  - Commit: end of session

- **Task:** Drafted Analyst v1 prompt
  - Files: `prompts/analyst_v1.md`
  - Outcome: Simplified 1000-word version for Phase 1 testing
  - Commit: end of session

- **Task:** Updated all documentation for consistency
  - Files: `requirements.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `prompts/analyst.md`
  - Outcome: All docs aligned with 5-phase plan and claude-code-sdk decision
  - Commit: end of session

### In Progress

None - Phase 1 planning complete

### Decisions Made

- **Decision:** Start with Analyst-only prototype
  - Alternatives considered: Build all agents at once
  - Why chosen: Validate core functionality early, learn as we go

- **Decision:** 5-phase implementation approach
  - Alternatives considered: 3-phase, continuous development
  - Why chosen: Clear milestones, testable at each stage

- **Decision:** Start with 1000-word analyses in Phase 1
  - Alternatives considered: Full 2500 words from start
  - Why chosen: Faster iteration, easier validation of structure

## Code Changes

### Created

- `implementation-plan.md` - Phased implementation strategy document
- `test_ideas.txt` - 15 diverse business ideas for testing
- `prompts/analyst_v1.md` - Simplified analyst prompt for Phase 1

### Modified

- `requirements.md` - Updated development phases to match new 5-phase plan
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated current phase, latest session, and timeline
- `prompts/analyst.md` - Added note about v1 word count

### Deleted

[To be filled as work progresses]

## Problems & Solutions

[To be filled if issues arise]

## Testing Status

- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing notes:

## Tools & Resources

- **MCP Tools Used:** [To be filled]
- **External Docs:** [To be filled]
- **AI Agents:** [To be filled]

## Next Session Priority

1. **Must Do:** Implement Phase 1 - Create analyze.py with basic Analyst agent
2. **Should Do:** Test with first 5 ideas from test_ideas.txt
3. **Could Do:** Start iterating on prompt based on output quality

## Open Questions

Questions that arose during this session:

[To be filled as questions arise]

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- Current state: All planning complete, ready for Phase 1 implementation
- Next immediate action: Create analyze.py with minimal Analyst agent using claude-code-sdk
- Watch out for:
  - Ensure claude-code-sdk-python is installed
  - WebSearch tool availability
  - Start with simple argparse, not Click yet

## Session Metrics

- Files created: 3 (implementation-plan.md, test_ideas.txt, analyst_v1.md)
- Files modified: 4 (requirements.md, CLAUDE.md, analyst.md, session log)
- Lines added: ~500+
- Documentation alignment: 100% consistent
