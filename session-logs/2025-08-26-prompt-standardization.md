# Session Log: Prompt Standardization and Tools Configuration

## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: 3f60419b-13a1-4b3b-b129-ad8e184160fa  
**Start Time:** 2025-08-26 19:15 PDT  
**End Time:** 2025-08-26 20:50 PDT  
**Previous Session:** 2025-08-26-citation-accuracy-improvements.md  
**Commit:** End of session

## Objectives

What I aimed to accomplish this session:

- [x] Standardize prompts by making citation-strict the default
- [x] Move tools instructions from user prompts to system prompts via includes
- [x] Create agent-specific tools_system.md files  
- [x] Make system prompts dynamically configurable based on CLI flags
- [x] Add system prompt logging for observability
- [x] Simplify and improve tools documentation

## Work Summary

### Completed

1. **Prompt Standardization Implementation**
   - Made citation-strict prompt the default for analyst (2.5x citation accuracy improvement)
   - Created agent-specific tools_system.md files with template variables
   - Moved ALL tools documentation from user prompts to system level
   - Implemented clean separation: system prompts for capabilities, user prompts for task

2. **Dynamic Tools Configuration**
   - Simplified assumptions: WebSearch/WebFetch always together, TodoWrite always available
   - Created web_tools_enabled.md and web_tools_disabled.md snippets
   - Reduced analyst.py formatting logic from ~90 lines to ~30 lines
   - All prompt text now in markdown files, no embedded strings in Python

3. **System Prompt Observability**
   - Added `log_system_prompt()` method to RunAnalytics
   - System prompts now saved to `logs/runs/{run_id}/analyst_system_prompt_iter{n}.md`
   - Full visibility into exactly what prompt the agent receives after variable substitution
   - Verified working with both web tools enabled and disabled

### Decisions Made

- **TodoWrite is always available** - Simplifies logic, useful for all analyses
- **WebSearch and WebFetch are paired** - Either both on or both off
- **All prompt text in markdown files** - No embedded strings in Python code
- **System prompts get runtime formatting** - Use load_prompt_with_includes() then format()

## Code Changes

### Created

- `config/prompts/agents/analyst/tools_system.md` - Tools documentation template
- `config/prompts/agents/analyst/snippets/web_tools_enabled.md` - With web tools
- `config/prompts/agents/analyst/snippets/web_tools_disabled.md` - Without web tools
- `config/prompts/agents/reviewer/tools_system.md` - Reviewer tools (minimal)
- `config/prompts/versions/analyst/analyst_v4.md` - Backup of previous default
- `config/prompts/versions/analyst/analyst_v5_citation_strict.md` - Backup of experimental
- `session-logs/2025-08-26-prompt-standardization-plan.md` - Implementation plan
- `session-logs/2025-08-26-prompt-standardization-implementation.md` - Results

### Modified

- `config/prompts/agents/analyst/system.md` - Replaced with citation-strict version
- `config/prompts/agents/analyst/user/initial.md` - Removed tools include
- `config/prompts/agents/analyst/user/revision.md` - Removed tools include  
- `src/agents/analyst.py` - Simplified to ~30 lines of formatting logic
- `src/core/run_analytics.py` - Added log_system_prompt() method
- `config/prompts/agents/reviewer/system.md` - Added tools_system.md include

### Deleted

- `config/prompts/agents/analyst/user/tools.md` - Moved to system level

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Understanding the Correct Approach

- **Issue:** Initial attempts modified base classes and created complex overrides
- **Solution:** Use load_prompt_with_includes() then format() - mirrors user prompt pattern
- **Learning:** Existing utilities already handle the use case perfectly

### Problem 2: Tools Documentation Placement

- **Issue:** Confusion about where tools documentation should live
- **Solution:** ALL tools info in system prompt, task instructions in user prompt
- **Learning:** Clean separation of concerns improves maintainability

### Problem 3: Markdown Linting

- **Issue:** Snippet files failed linting due to missing top-level headers
- **Solution:** Added proper headers to snippet files
- **Learning:** All markdown files need proper structure even if included

## Testing Status

- [x] System prompts correctly formatted with runtime variables
- [x] Web tools enabled: Shows correct tools list
- [x] Web tools disabled: Shows reduced tools list  
- [x] System prompts logged to correct location
- [x] Citation-strict prompt working as default

## Next Session Priority

### Phase 3: Judge Agent Implementation

With improved citation accuracy (2.5x better) and clean prompt architecture, ready for:

1. **Create Judge Agent** based on existing architecture patterns
2. **Implement 7-criteria evaluation** as specified in requirements
3. **Add grade command** to CLI

The cleaner prompt system will make Judge implementation straightforward.

## Key Insights

### What Worked Well

1. **Iterative refinement** - Multiple attempts led to cleaner solution
2. **User feedback** - Direct corrections pushed toward simpler approach
3. **Existing utilities** - load_prompt_with_includes() handled everything needed
4. **Clear separation** - Tools in system prompt, task in user prompt

### Lessons Learned for This User

1. **Start simple, iterate** - User prefers minimal solutions that work over complex perfect ones
2. **Show don't tell** - User wants to see actual test results, not just descriptions  
3. **Challenge assumptions** - "WebSearch and WebFetch always together" simplified everything
4. **Leverage existing code** - Don't reinvent when utilities like load_prompt_with_includes exist
5. **Aggressive timelines preferred** - User pushes for rapid iteration and simplification
6. **Direct feedback style** - User will say "you're not getting it" to redirect approach

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- **Current state:** Citation-strict prompt is default, system prompts fully observable
- **Next immediate action:** Begin Phase 3 - Judge agent implementation
- **Watch out for:** Keep same clean pattern for Judge prompts

## Session Metrics

- Lines of code: +200/-150 (net simplification)
- Files touched: 15
- Test runs: 8 successful integration tests
- Key achievement: 2.5x citation accuracy improvement now default
