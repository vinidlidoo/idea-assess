# Phase 2 Requirements Validation Checklist

## Requirements from requirements.md

### Phase 2: Add Reviewer Feedback (Days 3-4)

- [x] **Implement Reviewer agent with JSON feedback**
  - ✅ Created `src/agents/reviewer.py` with ReviewerAgent class
  - ✅ Returns structured JSON with feedback categories
  - ✅ Inherits from BaseAgent interface

- [x] **Add iteration controller (max 3 iterations)**
  - ✅ Implemented in `AnalysisPipeline.run_analyst_reviewer_loop()`
  - ✅ Hard limit of 3 iterations enforced
  - ✅ Tracks iteration count and history

- [x] **Enhance Analyst to incorporate feedback**
  - ✅ FeedbackProcessor.format_feedback_for_analyst() formats feedback
  - ✅ Pipeline passes formatted feedback to analyst for revision
  - ✅ Analyst receives previous analysis + feedback for improvements

- [ ] **Test improvement across iterations**
  - ⏳ Ready to test with real ideas
  - ⏳ Need to verify quality actually improves

- [x] **Validate stopping conditions**
  - ✅ Stops when reviewer accepts (recommendation = "accept")
  - ✅ Stops at max 3 iterations regardless
  - ✅ Binary accept/reject model implemented

## Agent Architecture Requirements

- [x] **Clear separation of responsibilities**
  - ✅ Analyst: Creates analysis from idea
  - ✅ Reviewer: Provides feedback on analysis quality
  - ✅ Each agent has single responsibility

- [x] **Sequential Processing**
  - ✅ Pipeline processes one idea at a time
  - ✅ Analyst → Reviewer → Analyst flow

## Additional Implementation Details

### Reviewer Agent Specifics

- [x] **JSON Feedback Structure**

  ```json
  {
    "overall_assessment": "string",
    "strengths": ["array"],
    "critical_issues": [{"section", "issue", "suggestion", "priority"}],
    "improvements": [{"section", "issue", "suggestion", "priority"}],
    "minor_suggestions": [{"section", "issue", "suggestion", "priority"}],
    "iteration_recommendation": "accept|reject",
    "iteration_reason": "string"
  }
  ```

- [x] **YC-Style Alignment**
  - ✅ Reviewer prompt aligned with analyst v3 YC sections
  - ✅ Checks for specific YC criteria (10x improvement, holy shit stats, etc.)

### CLI Integration

- [x] **New CLI Flags**
  - ✅ `--with-review` enables reviewer feedback loop
  - ✅ `--max-iterations` controls iteration limit (1-3)
  - ✅ Shows accept/reject status in output

### Pipeline Features

- [x] **Iteration History**
  - ✅ Saves all iterations in JSON history file
  - ✅ Tracks feedback for each iteration
  - ✅ Shows final status (accepted vs max iterations)

## What's NOT Implemented Yet (Phase 3-5)

- [ ] Judge Agent (Phase 3)
- [ ] Grading system (Phase 3)
- [ ] Synthesizer Agent (Phase 4)
- [ ] Comparative reports (Phase 4)
- [ ] Click CLI upgrade (Phase 4)
- [ ] Error recovery and retries (Phase 5)

## Compliance Summary

✅ **Phase 2 Core Requirements Met**: All major requirements implemented
⏳ **Testing Needed**: Functional testing with real ideas required
✅ **Architecture Aligned**: Follows specified agent separation pattern
✅ **Ready for Phase 3**: Foundation laid for Judge agent addition
