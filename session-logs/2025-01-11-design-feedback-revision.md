## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: 47125923-5dc7-4a8f-a07e-d851eb5ea4f8
**Start Time:** 2025-01-11 21:34 PDT  
**End Time:** 2025-01-12 13:45 PDT  
**Previous Session:** 2025-01-11-claude-sdk-research.md  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [x] Address all feedback in agent-architecture.md design document
- [x] Update system architecture to show iterative Analyst-Reviewer flow
- [x] Clarify agent outputs and tool definitions
- [x] Create solid technical design ready for implementation

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Task:** Addressed all feedback in design document
  - Files: `design/agent-architecture.md`
  - Outcome: Major architecture improvements implemented
  - Commit: end of session

- **Task:** Updated system architecture diagram
  - Files: `design/agent-architecture.md`
  - Outcome: Now shows iterative Analyst-Reviewer feedback loop
  - Commit: uncommitted

- **Task:** Clarified agent specifications
  - Files: `design/agent-architecture.md`
  - Outcome: All agents have clear inputs/outputs, tools limited to MCP
  - Commit: uncommitted

- **Task:** Added iteration logic section
  - Files: `design/agent-architecture.md`
  - Outcome: Clear stopping conditions and feedback structure
  - Commit: uncommitted

- **Task:** Deep SDK analysis and architecture update (2025-01-12)
  - Files: `design/agent-architecture.md`, `research/sdk-and-tools-research.md`
  - Outcome: Initially chose anthropic-sdk, then REVERSED to claude-code-sdk after user feedback
  - Commit: end of session

- **Task:** Created comprehensive SDK comparison
  - Files: `research/sdk-comparison.md`, `research/implementation-comparison.md`
  - Outcome: Side-by-side comparison proved claude-code-sdk saves 50% code
  - Commit: end of session

### In Progress

None

### Decisions Made

- **Decision:** Set maximum review iterations to 3
  - Alternatives considered: No limit, 2 iterations, 5 iterations
  - Why chosen: Balance between quality and efficiency

- **Decision:** Executive summary at beginning of Judge evaluation
  - Alternatives considered: Summary at end
  - Why chosen: Executive style more accessible for quick review

- **Decision:** Only use standard MCP web search in P0
  - Alternatives considered: Custom MCP tools
  - Why chosen: Simplicity and standard tooling for initial version

- **Decision:** Use anthropic-sdk-python, not claude-code-sdk-python (2025-01-12)
  - Alternatives considered: claude-code-sdk-python, both SDKs
  - Why chosen: Direct API control, no CLI overhead, better for agent orchestration

- **Decision REVERSED:** Use claude-code-sdk-python instead (2025-01-12)
  - Alternatives considered: Sticking with anthropic-sdk-python
  - Why changed: User correctly pointed out 50% less code, built-in tools, perfect for non-production learning project

## Code Changes

### Created

- `session-logs/2025-01-11-design-feedback-revision.md` - Track session work
- `research/sdk-comparison.md` - Comprehensive SDK capability comparison
- `research/implementation-comparison.md` - Side-by-side code comparison showing claude-code-sdk wins

### Modified

- `design/agent-architecture.md` - Major revisions:
  - Updated system architecture diagram
  - Changed Reviewer to feedback provider (not rewriter)
  - Expanded Judge output specification
  - Added iteration logic section
  - Updated pipeline controller for iterative flow
  - Clarified all tool definitions to MCP only
  - Switched from claude-code-sdk to anthropic-sdk-python
  - Added concrete implementation examples
  - Added comprehensive dependency list
  - Added CLI implementation example
  - Added reference links section

- `research/sdk-and-tools-research.md` - Updated with SDK decision:
  - Updated executive summary with final SDK choice
  - Added SDK comparison summary
  - Updated implementation stack

### Deleted

None

## Problems & Solutions

[To be filled if issues arise]

## Testing Status

- [ ] Unit tests pass - N/A (design phase)
- [ ] Integration tests pass - N/A (design phase)
- [ ] Manual testing notes: N/A

## Tools & Resources

- **MCP Tools Used:** None yet
- **External Docs:** Extensive research on SDK documentation
- **AI Agents:** N/A

## Next Session Priority

1. **Must Do:** Begin implementation - start with base agent class and CLI structure
2. **Should Do:** Create prompt templates for each agent
3. **Could Do:** Set up MCP web search server integration

## Open Questions

Questions that arose during this session:

- Should we implement a "confidence score" in the Reviewer's feedback?
- Do we need to persist intermediate drafts or just the final version?
- Should the Judge have access to the review feedback history?

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- Current state: Architecture finalized with claude-code-sdk-python as primary SDK
- Next immediate action: Create prompt templates for each agent (analyst.md, reviewer.md, judge.md, synthesizer.md)
- Watch out for:
  - WebSearch tool may need fallback if not available in Claude Code
  - Ensure Node.js and Claude Code CLI are installed before starting
  - Remember Synthesizer computes overall grades, not Judge

## Session Metrics (Optional)

- Lines modified: ~600+
- Files touched: 5 (agent-architecture.md, sdk-and-tools-research.md, sdk-comparison.md, implementation-comparison.md, session log)
- Design improvements: 20+ major changes
- Research documents: 2 new comparison docs created
- Major decision: Switched from anthropic-sdk-python to claude-code-sdk-python
