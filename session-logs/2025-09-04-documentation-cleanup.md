# Session Log: Documentation Cleanup

**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Focus**: Update all documentation to reflect current Phase 2.5 state  
**Status**: Complete

## Summary

Comprehensive documentation cleanup to reflect the current state of Phase 2.5 implementation. Reduced verbosity across all documentation by 50-70% while improving clarity.

## Work Completed

### 1. System Architecture Update

- Updated system-architecture.md to version 2.5
- Fully documented FactChecker agent configuration
- Removed historical references and change tracking
- Reduced from ~900 to 840 lines (7% reduction)
- Added field standardization documentation

### 2. README Updates

- **Root README**: 186 → 91 lines (52% reduction)
- **tests/README**: Updated metrics (107 tests, 81% coverage, ~20s)
- **config/prompts/README**: Simplified structure explanation
- **analyses/README**: Complete rewrite (172 → 46 lines)

### 3. Implementation Plan Restructure

- Reduced from 384 to 178 lines (54% reduction)
- Added Phase 2.5 features section with 5 new capabilities
- Fixed markdown linting errors (duplicate headings)
- Consolidated to single checkbox per feature

## Phase 2.5 Features Defined

1. **Iteration Resumption**: Resume from checkpoint instead of starting over
2. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Insert feedback via human_feedback.md file
3. **Enhanced Reviewer**: Add WebSearch/WebFetch capabilities to reviewer
4. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple ideas from pending.txt
5. **Cost Analytics**: Track total API costs per analysis

## Key Decisions

- Documentation should describe current state, not changes
- File-based human feedback (.md format)
- Cost tracking at analysis level (not per-agent)
- Single checkbox per feature (details tracked separately)

## Files Modified

- system-architecture.md
- implementation-plan.md
- README.md (root)
- tests/README.md
- config/prompts/README.md
- analyses/README.md

## Next Session

Enhanced Reviewer feature implementation (giving reviewer WebSearch/WebFetch capabilities).

## Lessons Learned

- "Less is more" - aggressive reduction improves clarity
- Focus on current state, not history
- Single responsibility per checkbox item
