# Session Log: 2025-08-14 - Phase 2 Reviewer Agent Implementation

## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: b68836db-3dab-4d8d-b76f-5c8781ed2d5d
**Start Time:** 2025-08-14 11:31 PDT  
**End Time:** 2025-08-14 12:58 PDT  
**Previous Session:** 2025-08-14-analyze-refactor-prep.md  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [x] Implement ReviewerAgent using new BaseAgent interface
- [x] Create agent pipeline for Analyst->Reviewer feedback loop  
- [ ] Test iteration controller with max 3 iterations
- [ ] Validate quality improvements across iterations
- [ ] If time permits: Add batch processing support from TODO.md

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Task:** Created reviewer_v1.md prompt template aligned with YC-style analyst v3
  - Files: `config/prompts/reviewer_v1.md`
  - Outcome: Reviewer provides structured JSON feedback with accept/reject decisions
  - Commit: uncommitted

- **Task:** Implemented ReviewerAgent class inheriting from BaseAgent
  - Files: `src/agents/reviewer.py`
  - Outcome: Full agent implementation with FeedbackProcessor utility class
  - Commit: uncommitted

- **Task:** Created Pipeline orchestrator for agent coordination
  - Files: `src/core/pipeline.py`
  - Outcome: AnalysisPipeline handles iterative feedback loop with max 3 iterations
  - Commit: uncommitted

- **Task:** Updated CLI to support reviewer feedback workflow
  - Files: `src/cli.py`
  - Outcome: Added --with-review and --max-iterations flags
  - Commit: uncommitted

- **Task:** Implemented accept/reject iteration logic
  - Files: Updated reviewer prompt and FeedbackProcessor
  - Outcome: Simplified to binary accept/reject per requirements
  - Commit: uncommitted

### In Progress

- **Task:** Testing and validation
  - Status: Ready to test with real business ideas
  - Blockers: None

### Decisions Made

- **Decision:** Used accept/reject model instead of continue/accept/reject
  - Alternatives considered: Three-state model with continue option
  - Why chosen: Simpler logic, aligns with requirements doc

- **Decision:** Aligned reviewer prompt with YC-style analyst v3 sections
  - Alternatives considered: Keep generic sections
  - Why chosen: Ensures consistency between analyst output and reviewer expectations

## Code Changes

### Created

- `config/prompts/reviewer_v1.md` - YC-style reviewer prompt template
- `src/agents/reviewer.py` - ReviewerAgent implementation with FeedbackProcessor
- `src/core/pipeline.py` - Pipeline orchestrator for multi-agent coordination

### Modified

- `src/cli.py` - Added reviewer workflow support with new flags
- `src/agents/__init__.py` - Added ReviewerAgent exports
- `src/core/__init__.py` - Added Pipeline exports

### Deleted

- None

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Reviewer prompt misalignment

- **Issue:** Reviewer prompt was misaligned with YC-style analyst v3 output
- **Solution:** Updated reviewer prompt to match exact section names and criteria
- **Learning:** Prompts must be kept in sync when agent outputs change

### Problem 2: Iteration logic complexity

- **Issue:** Iteration logic was too complex with three states
- **Solution:** Simplified to binary accept/reject per requirements
- **Learning:** Simpler logic is often better for clear control flow

### Problem 3: Claude SDK API usage errors

- **Issue:** Multiple incorrect SDK patterns - wrong method calls, async/await issues
- **Solution:** Fixed to use proper async context manager and receive_response() pattern
- **Learning:** Must follow SDK's specific async patterns exactly

### Problem 4: Message content extraction

- **Issue:** Not properly extracting text from ContentBlocks in AssistantMessages
- **Solution:** Research revealed need to iterate through message.content blocks and extract block.text
- **Learning:** Claude SDK uses ContentBlock structure, not raw strings

### Problem 5: Reviewer still not working

- **Issue:** Multiple UserMessages appearing, JSON not being returned properly
- **Solution:** Partially fixed but still issues - may be content policy or prompt complexity
- **Learning:** Need to investigate why Claude sends UserMessages in response stream

## Testing Status

- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing notes: Ready for testing with --with-review flag

## Tools & Resources

- **MCP Tools Used:** None (reviewer doesn't need external tools)
- **External Docs:** Claude SDK Python repo for best practices
- **AI Agents:** Code-reviewer agent used for Phase 1 review

## Next Session Priority

1. **Must Do:** Test with multiple real business ideas to validate quality improvements
2. **Should Do:** Begin Phase 3 - Implement Judge agent for evaluation
3. **Could Do:** Add batch processing support from TODO.md

## Open Questions

Questions that arose during this session:

- Should rejected analyses at max iterations be saved with a warning?
- Should we track which specific feedback led to improvements?

## Handoff Notes

### CRITICAL - Current State

The reviewer is **NOT fully working yet**. While Phase 2 architecture is complete, the reviewer agent has a persistent issue:

**The Problem:**

- Reviewer receives strange message sequence: SystemMessage → AssistantMessage → multiple UserMessages → ResultMessage
- Only gets partial text in first AssistantMessage ("I'll review this...")
- JSON feedback is never generated
- System defaults to accepting analyses without real review

**What's Been Fixed:**

1. ✅ Claude SDK API patterns (async context manager, receive_response())
2. ✅ ContentBlock text extraction (iterate blocks, get block.text)
3. ✅ Debug logging to trace message flow
4. ✅ Reviewer prompt aligned with YC-style analyst output
5. ✅ Pipeline orchestration with iteration control

**What Still Needs Investigation:**

1. ❌ Why are UserMessages appearing in the response stream?
2. ❌ Why is Claude not generating the JSON feedback?
3. ❌ Is this a content policy issue with reviewing + alcohol content?
4. ❌ Could the prompt be too complex for reliable JSON output?

### Next Session Priority

1. **MUST Debug Reviewer Issue**:
   - Check latest debug logs in `logs/debug_20250814_125456.json`
   - Note the strange UserMessage pattern
   - Consider simpler prompt or different approach
   - Maybe test with non-alcohol business ideas

2. **Key Files to Review**:
   - `src/agents/reviewer_fixed.py` - Latest reviewer implementation
   - `config/prompts/reviewer_v1.md` - Current JSON-based prompt
   - `logs/debug_*.json` - Debug logs showing message patterns

3. **Potential Solutions to Try**:
   - Simplify reviewer prompt further
   - Remove JSON requirement, use structured text
   - Test with different business ideas (non-alcohol)
   - Check if SDK has limitations with complex prompts

### Important Context

- User prefers JSON output from reviewer (explicitly stated)
- Claude SDK doesn't have `--output-format json` equivalent
- ContentBlocks must be properly extracted from AssistantMessages
- Pipeline expects `iteration_recommendation` of "accept" or "reject"

### Session Metrics

- Duration: 1 hour 27 minutes
- Context usage: 75% at session end
- Files created: 5 (reviewer implementations, prompts)
- Issues resolved: 4 of 5 major problems
- **Status: Phase 2 architecture complete but reviewer not functioning**

## Final Summary

Phase 2 implementation is architecturally complete but the reviewer agent has a critical bug preventing it from generating feedback. The next session must debug why UserMessages appear in the response stream and why JSON feedback isn't being generated. The issue appears to be with how Claude processes the review request, possibly due to content policy or prompt complexity.

**Recommendation**: Start next session by testing reviewer with simpler, non-alcohol business ideas and checking if the issue is content-specific or systemic.
