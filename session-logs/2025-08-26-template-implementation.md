## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: c6323696-6d47-48c5-9b78-9bb40fe45bb6
**Start Time:** 2025-08-26 08:04 PDT  
**End Time:** 2025-08-26 10:45 PDT  
**Previous Session:** 2025-08-26-template-decoupling-design.md  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [x] Answer user's questions about the template decoupling design
- [x] Implement Phase 1 - Infrastructure setup (template loading utility)
- [x] Create initial templates for analyst and reviewer
- [x] Complete pipeline integration with template system

## Work Summary

### Template-Prompt Decoupling Implementation

1. **Created plain markdown templates** (not Jinja2 as originally planned)
   - `config/templates/agents/analyst/analysis.md` - Rich template with embedded TODO instructions
   - `config/templates/agents/reviewer/feedback.json` - JSON template with instructions

2. **Implemented template operations** in `src/utils/file_operations.py`
   - Merged template_operations.py into file_operations.py for better organization
   - Added functions: load_template, create_file_from_template, append_metadata_to_analysis

3. **Achieved true template-prompt decoupling**
   - Moved all structural information from prompts to templates
   - Analyst system prompt reduced from 153 to 73 lines
   - Reviewer system prompt reduced from 184 to 89 lines
   - Templates now contain detailed TODO instructions with all requirements
   - Prompts now focus only on principles and approach

4. **Consolidated websearch prompt files**
   - Merged websearch_instruction.md and websearch_disabled.md into constraints.md
   - Updated analyst.py to build websearch_instruction dynamically
   - Removed redundant prompt files

5. **Fixed prompt loading consistency**
   - Updated initial.md and revision.md to use `{{include:agents/analyst/user/constraints.md}}`
   - Now using `load_prompt_with_includes` consistently for all prompts that have includes
   - Removed redundant loading of constraints.md
   - All user prompts now properly use includes while maintaining variable substitution

6. **Fixed revision workflow bug**
   - Added `previous_analysis_input_path` field to AnalystContext  
   - Pipeline now computes and passes the previous iteration's analysis path
   - Analyst properly passes the path to the revision template
   - Revisions can now correctly reference the previous analysis file

7. **Fixed turn efficiency issue**
   - Centralized all file operation instructions in file_edit_rules.md
   - Instructed agents to replace entire template content in ONE Edit operation
   - Removed tool-specific instructions from individual prompts for maintainability
   - Added workflow guidance allowing research/WebSearch before file operations
   - This prevents analysts from burning through turns with individual edits

8. **Updated pipeline.py** to use template system
   - Both analyst and reviewer now create files from templates
   - Fixed type checking issues with template_dir

### Key Design Decisions

- **Plain markdown over Jinja2**: Simpler, sufficient for current needs
- **Rich templates**: All structure and requirements embedded in templates as TODOs
- **Simplified prompts**: Focus on quality principles, not structure
- **File consolidation**: Merged utilities, consolidated similar prompt files

### Completed

  - Files: Created session log
  - Outcome: Ready to begin implementation
