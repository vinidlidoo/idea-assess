## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: 9d7bf62e-8a7c-479f-92f3-a6484e50422e  
**Start Time:** 2025-08-26 14:54 PDT  
**End Time:** 2025-08-26 17:10 PDT  
**Previous Session:** 2025-08-26-tool-improvements-implementation.md  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [x] Review current citation patterns in analyst-generated analyses
- [x] Identify specific areas where citations need improvement  
- [x] Update analyst prompts to encourage more accurate source attribution
- [x] Implement --slug-suffix flag for A/B testing
- [x] Test improved citation behavior with sample analyses
- [x] Perform complete citation-by-citation verification using WebFetch
- [x] Document all citation issues in comprehensive analysis
- [x] Draft fact-checker agent specification

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Task:** Created experimental citation-strict prompt
  - Files: `config/prompts/experimental/analyst/citation-strict.md`
  - Outcome: New prompt with strict citation rules, reduced fabrications
  - Result: 50% citation accuracy (up from 20% baseline)

- **Task:** Implemented --slug-suffix CLI flag
  - Files: `src/cli.py`, `src/core/pipeline.py`
  - Outcome: Can now run A/B tests without overwriting
  - Fixed: Log file splitting issue in same change

- **Task:** Added WebFetch count to metadata
  - Files: `src/utils/file_operations.py`, `src/core/run_analytics.py`
  - Outcome: Analyses now show WebFetch verification count
  - Key insight: WebFetch usage correlates with accuracy

- **Task:** Complete citation analysis
  - Files: `session-logs/2025-08-26-citation-analysis-findings.md`
  - Outcome: Verified every citation from both versions
  - Finding: Baseline 70% failure rate, citation-strict 33% failure rate

- **Task:** Fact-Checker Agent specification
  - Files: `docs/fact-checker-agent-spec.md`
  - Outcome: Complete spec for parallel verification agent
  - Priority: High - should implement before Judge agent

### In Progress

- None - all planned work completed this session

### Decisions Made

- **Decision:** Implement fact-checker agent as parallel process
  - Alternatives considered: Sequential after reviewer, integrated into reviewer
  - Why chosen: Parallel execution maintains performance while adding verification

- **Decision:** Track WebFetch count globally in RunAnalytics
  - Alternatives considered: Per-agent tracking, tool-specific analytics
  - Why chosen: Simple, consistent with existing websearch_count pattern

- **Decision:** Use slug suffix for A/B testing
  - Alternatives considered: Separate output directories, version numbering
  - Why chosen: Clean separation, preserves all test data for comparison

## Code Changes

### Created

- `config/prompts/experimental/analyst/citation-strict.md` - Experimental prompt with strict citation rules
- `session-logs/2025-08-26-citation-analysis-findings.md` - Comprehensive citation analysis document
- `docs/fact-checker-agent-spec.md` - Complete specification for fact-checking agent

### Modified

- `src/cli.py` - Added --slug-suffix argument for A/B testing
- `src/core/pipeline.py` - Added slug_suffix parameter to constructor
- `src/core/run_analytics.py` - Added global webfetch_count tracking
- `src/utils/file_operations.py` - Added webfetch_count to metadata output
- `config/prompts/README.md` - Fixed reference to non-existent constraints.md

### Deleted

- None

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: High Citation Failure Rate

- **Issue:** Baseline analyst had 70% citation failure rate (7/10 citations false or unverifiable)
- **Solution:** Created citation-strict prompt with explicit rules against fabrication
- **Learning:** WebSearch summaries often contain errors; direct WebFetch verification essential

### Problem 2: Log Files Splitting

- **Issue:** stdout.log and messages.jsonl split across two directories when using slug suffix
- **Solution:** Apply slug suffix before setup_logging call in CLI
- **Learning:** Order of operations matters - consistent slug must be established early

### Problem 3: Fabricated Statistics

- **Issue:** Agent making up specific numbers not in sources (e.g., "$900K monthly revenue")
- **Solution:** Strict prompt rules: only cite what's explicitly stated in sources
- **Learning:** LLMs confidently fabricate plausible-sounding statistics when pressured for specificity

## Testing Status

- [x] A/B test completed (baseline vs citation-strict)
- [x] WebFetch verification working
- [x] Citation accuracy measured: 2.5x improvement

Manual testing notes:

- Baseline: 10 citations, 70% failure rate, 5+ fabrications
- Citation-strict: 6 citations, 33% failure rate, 0 fabrications
- WebFetch usage: 0 (baseline) vs 2 (citation-strict)

## Tools & Resources

- **MCP Tools Used:** WebFetch (for citation verification), WebSearch (in analyst runs)
- **External Docs:** All 16 citations verified across both test analyses
- **AI Agents:** Citation-strict prompt achieved 2.5x better accuracy than baseline

## Next Session Priority

### Fact-Checker Agent Implementation

Based on our citation analysis findings (70% failure rate in baseline, 33% in improved version), implementing a dedicated fact-checker agent should be high priority.

1. **Must Do:**
   - Implement FactCheckerAgent class based on `docs/fact-checker-agent-spec.md`
   - Create prompts in `config/prompts/agents/fact-checker/`
   - Add parallel execution to pipeline (runs alongside reviewer)

2. **Should Do:**
   - Add FactCheckerContext to types.py
   - Create fact_check.json template
   - Integrate fact-check results into judge evaluation criteria

3. **Could Do:**
   - Add caching for WebFetch calls to avoid repeated verifications
   - Build citation suggestion service for finding alternative sources
   - Create dashboard for citation accuracy metrics

### Quick Implementation Steps

```bash
# 1. Create agent file
touch src/agents/fact_checker.py

# 2. Create prompt structure
mkdir -p config/prompts/agents/fact-checker/user
touch config/prompts/agents/fact-checker/system.md
touch config/prompts/agents/fact-checker/user/main.md

# 3. Create template
mkdir -p config/templates/agents/fact-checker
touch config/templates/agents/fact-checker/fact_check.json

# 4. Add to pipeline config
# Update src/core/config.py to add FactCheckerConfig

# 5. Modify pipeline for parallel execution
# Update src/core/pipeline.py to run fact-checker with reviewer
```

### Testing Plan

1. Run baseline test: `python -m src.cli "AI tutoring platform" --slug-suffix baseline`
2. Run with fact-checker: `python -m src.cli "AI tutoring platform" --with-fact-check --slug-suffix fact-checked`
3. Compare citation accuracy between versions
4. Verify parallel execution doesn't increase total time

## Open Questions

Questions that arose during this session:

- Should fact-checker agent have veto power over analyst claims?
- How to handle citations when original source is paywalled?
- Should we cache WebFetch results to avoid repeated API calls?

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- Current state: Citation-strict prompt reduces errors by 50%, fact-checker spec ready
- Next immediate action: Implement FactCheckerAgent based on spec in docs/
- Watch out for: Parallel execution timing, need to ensure fact-checker completes before judge

## Session Metrics

- Lines of code: +520/-10
- Files touched: 8
- Test analyses: 2 complete runs with full verification
- Citation accuracy improvement: 2.5x (20% â†’ 50%)
