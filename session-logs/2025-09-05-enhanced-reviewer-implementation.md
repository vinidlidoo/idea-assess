# Session: Enhanced Reviewer Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-05  
**Phase**: 2.5 - Enhanced Reviewer Feature  
**Goal**: Implement web verification capabilities for ReviewerAgent

## Summary

Successfully implemented the Enhanced Reviewer feature, giving the ReviewerAgent web verification capabilities (WebSearch/WebFetch) to catch unrealistic startup claims and missing competitors. The implementation achieves its primary goal of identifying issues that would otherwise slip through.

## What I Did

### 1. Analyzed Requirements and Created Implementation Plan

- Reviewed ReviewBot analysis gaps to understand what needed catching
- Created comprehensive implementation plan with phased approach
- Selected Option 1: Add verification_notes field to existing template
- Focused on strategic verification vs FactChecker's systematic checks

### 2. Updated ReviewerConfig with Web Capabilities

```python
@dataclass
class ReviewerConfig(BaseAgentConfig):
    max_iterations: int = 3
    strictness: str = "normal"
    max_websearches: int = 8  # Web searches for strategic verification
    
    allowed_tools: list[str] = field(
        default_factory=lambda: ["WebSearch", "WebFetch", "TodoWrite"]
    )
```

### 3. Modified Reviewer Agent Implementation

- Added max_websearches to user prompt formatting in reviewer.py
- Passed variable through to prompt templates
- Maintained compatibility with existing functionality

### 4. Rewrote Reviewer Prompts

**System Prompt Updates**:

- Removed redundant verification content
- Focused on principles: "Point out problems, don't prescribe solutions"
- Emphasized strategic verification of key claims

**Tools System Prompt**:

- Complete rewrite with resource limits section
- Added strategic verification guidance
- Specified {max_websearches} variable substitution

### 5. Enhanced Feedback Template

Added verification_notes field to feedback.json:

```json
"verification_notes": [
  "[TODO: List key findings from your web searches. Examples:",
  "- Searched 'AI code review tools 2024' - found multiple major competitors not mentioned",
  "- Verified '50M dataset' claim - could not find evidence of this dataset existing",
  "..."
]
```

### 6. Tested Implementation

- Integration test with test_pipeline_live.py passed
- End-to-end CLI test with 3 iterations (~36 minutes)
- Successfully caught missing competitors and unrealistic claims

## Key Results

### What Worked Well

1. **Strategic Web Verification**: Caught 10+ missing competitors, GitHub Copilot's October 2024 launch, unrealistic growth benchmarks
2. **Less Prescriptive Tone**: Points out issues without dictating exact fixes
3. **Parallel Processing**: Reviewer and FactChecker run simultaneously
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Visible progression across iterations

### Areas Still Needing Improvement

1. **Analyst Not Proactively Checking Realism**: Still makes unverified claims
2. **Web Search Efficiency**: Multiple JSON parsing errors, redundant searches
3. **Feedback Integration**: Analyst makes minimum changes rather than comprehensive fixes
4. **Turn Count Explosion**: Risk of hitting API limits with complex analyses

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified

- `/src/core/config.py` - Added max_websearches to ReviewerConfig
- `/src/agents/reviewer.py` - Added variable to prompt formatting
- `/config/prompts/agents/reviewer/system.md` - Less prescriptive tone
- `/config/prompts/agents/reviewer/tools_system.md` - Complete rewrite
- `/config/templates/agents/reviewer/feedback.json` - Added verification_notes
- `/tests/fixtures/test_data.py` - Updated with ReviewBot example

### Files Created

- `/docs/enhance-reviewer/implementation-plan.md` - Comprehensive plan
- `/docs/phase-2.5-enhanced-reviewer/implementation-analysis.md` - Results analysis

## Lessons Learned

1. **Balance is Critical**: Finding the right balance between prescriptive and vague feedback is challenging
2. **Strategic vs Systematic**: Clear role separation (Reviewer vs FactChecker) is essential
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Multiple iterations needed to get tone right
4. **Integration Testing**: Live tests essential for validating agent interactions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Fixes

1. Add competitor research as mandatory first step for analyst
2. Include "reality check" prompt for startup claims
3. Better error handling for search result parsing
4. Strengthen analyst prompt to verify claims before writing

### Medium-term Improvements

1. Implement feedback summarization between iterations
2. Add caching for repeated searches
3. Create feedback priority system
4. Improve analyst's understanding of reviewer feedback

## Conclusion

The Enhanced Reviewer feature is production-ready and successfully catches more issues through strategic web verification. While significant improvements remain in how the analyst integrates feedback and upfront research, the core functionality achieves its goals.
