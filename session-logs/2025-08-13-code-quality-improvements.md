# Session Log: 2025-08-13 - Code Quality Improvements

## Session Context

**Claude Code Session ID**: c4a69d1e-8389-4308-a7cf-9d051e03c33a
**Start Time:** 2025-08-13 09:47 PDT  
**End Time:** 2025-08-13 10:25 PDT  
**Previous Session:** 2025-08-12-websearch-fix-cleanup.md  

## Objectives

What I'm trying to accomplish this session:

- [x] Raise code quality bar on analyze.py (refactoring, better structure)
- [x] Add flag to disable WebSearch (--no-websearch)
- [x] Implement proper interrupt handling (Ctrl+C support)
- [x] Test improvements with multiple ideas

## Work Summary

### Completed

- **Task:** Refactored analyze.py for professional code quality
  - Files: src/analyze.py
  - Outcome: Clean, modular code with dataclasses, type hints, and clear organization
  
- **Task:** Added --no-websearch/-n flag
  - Files: src/analyze.py  
  - Outcome: Can now disable WebSearch for fast testing (38s vs 150s+)
  
- **Task:** Implemented proper interrupt handling
  - Files: src/analyze.py
  - Outcome: Ctrl+C gracefully stops analysis using SDK's client.interrupt()
  
- **Task:** Fixed prompt to generate content directly
  - Files: config/prompts/analyst_v1.md
  - Outcome: Agent now generates analysis directly without asking permission

- **Task:** Enhanced debug logging to show message content
  - Files: src/analyze.py
  - Outcome: Debug logs now show WebSearch queries and results, making debugging easier

### In Progress

None - all objectives completed

### Decisions Made

- **Decision:** Use dataclasses for structured data
  - Alternatives considered: Plain dicts, named tuples
  - Why chosen: Type safety, clean API, automatic **init**
  
- **Decision:** Signal handler with asyncio task for interrupt
  - Alternatives considered: Direct client.interrupt() call, KeyboardInterrupt exception
  - Why chosen: Works properly with async context and SDK expectations

## Code Changes

### Created

None

### Modified

- src/analyze.py - Complete refactor with dataclasses, type hints, better organization
- config/prompts/analyst_v1.md - Added explicit instruction to generate content directly

### Deleted

None

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: [To be filled]

- **Issue:** [To be filled]
- **Solution:** [To be filled]
- **Learning:** [To be filled]

## Testing Status

- [ ] Unit tests pass (N/A - Phase 1)
- [ ] Integration tests pass (N/A - Phase 1)
- [x] Manual testing notes:
  - Help output shows new flags correctly
  - --no-websearch/-n flag works (38s vs 150s+ runtime)
  - Interrupt handling tested (shows warning, attempts graceful shutdown)
  - Debug mode captures all messages and timing
  - Analyses generate properly with both modes

## Tools & Resources

- **MCP Tools Used:** [To be filled]
- **External Docs:** [To be filled]
- **AI Agents:** [To be filled]

## Next Session Priority

1. **Must Do:** Improve analyzer output quality through prompt iteration
   - Focus on analyst_v1.md refinement
   - Test with diverse ideas to identify weaknesses
   - Ensure analyses are specific and actionable
2. **Should Do:** Enhanced debug logging (now captures message previews)
3. **Could Do:** Begin Phase 2 - Reviewer agent after analyzer quality is solid

## Open Questions

Questions that arose during this session:

- Why does interrupt handling show "Command failed with exit code -2"?
- Should we save partial analyses when interrupted?
- Consider adding progress bar instead of message counts?

## Handoff Notes

Clear context for next session:

- Current state: Phase 1 code complete, but output quality needs improvement
- Next immediate action: Iterate on analyst_v1.md prompt for better analysis quality
- Watch out for: Test with diverse ideas to identify prompt weaknesses
- Key insight: --no-websearch mode is 4x faster for testing prompt iterations
- Debug logging enhanced: Now captures message content previews for better visibility

## Session Metrics

- Files created: 0
- Files modified: 2 (analyze.py, analyst_v1.md)
- Files archived: 0
- Lines of code: ~570 (complete rewrite + debug enhancements)
- Test coverage: N/A (Phase 1)
