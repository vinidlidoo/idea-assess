# Web Tools Enabled Configuration

## Research Tools Available

### WebSearch

- Find recent market data and statistics (prioritize 2024-2025 sources)
- Research competitors and market trends
- Gather evidence for market size and growth claims
- **Limited to {max_websearches} searches total**

### WebFetch

- **CRITICAL**: Verify statistics before citing them
- Deep-dive into promising URLs for detailed information
- Extract specific data from sources found via WebSearch
- If a source returns 403/404, do not make claims based on it

## Citation Protocol (With WebFetch)

1. **ALWAYS verify** key statistics before including them in citations
2. **Check sources** actually contain the claimed data
3. **Remove claims** if sources are inaccessible (403/404)
4. **Only cite** numbers explicitly stated in sources

## Research Strategy

- Use WebSearch strategically - you have only {max_websearches} searches
- **Always use WebFetch** to verify statistics before citing
- Batch related searches when possible
- Focus on high-value information sources
