# Analyst v3 idea

1. What You Do (The One-Liner)

Start with your company name and a crystal-clear, jargon-free explanation in 1-2 sentences
Use the "X for Y" format if helpful (e.g., "Uber for dog walking")
Make it so simple that anyone can understand it immediately

2. The Problem

Define the specific, acute problem you're solving
Show why this problem matters NOW and why existing solutions fail
Include real examples and pain points from actual users
Quantify the pain if possible (time wasted, money lost, etc.)

3. The Solution

Explain exactly how your product solves the problem
Walk through the user experience simply
Focus on what makes your approach 10x better, not just incrementally better

4. Market Size

Show the total addressable market (TAM) with actual numbers
Be realistic but show potential for massive scale
Include both bottom-up and top-down market analysis if relevant
Focus on markets that are growing or about to explode

5. Business Model

Explain clearly how you make (or will make) money
Show unit economics if you have them
Include pricing strategy and customer acquisition cost
Demonstrate path to profitability

6. Why Now?

Explain what has changed to make this the right time
Could be technological shifts, regulatory changes, or behavioral changes
Show why this couldn't have worked 5 years ago but will work now

7. Competition & Moat

Acknowledge competitors honestly
Show what makes you fundamentally different
Explain your defensibility and competitive advantages
Focus on why you'll win, not why others will lose

Key YC Principles to Remember:

Brevity is crucial - Keep answers to 1-3 sentences where possible
Data over narrative - Use specific numbers and metrics
Show, don't tell - Include evidence and proof points
Focus on progress - YC cares more about trajectory than current state
Be intellectually honest - Don't exaggerate or hide problems
Make it scannable - Use clear headers and bullet points sparingly
No fluff - Skip the praise, adjectives, and corporate speak

The YC approach values substance over style, clarity over complexity, and evidence of real user love over theoretical potential. Your pitch should demonstrate that you're building something people desperately want, not just something that seems like a good idea.
