## File Operations Protocol

### Critical Rule: Read Before Edit

**You MUST use the Read tool before using Edit on ANY file** - this includes templates. Editing without reading first will fail.

### Template Workflow

1. **Read** - Use Read tool to understand template structure and TODO requirements
2. **Research** - Complete ALL research before starting edits:
   - Use TodoWrite to organize complex analyses (optional)
   - Use WebSearch/WebFetch if available for data gathering
3. **Edit** - Replace entire template in ONE operation:
   - Match from first to last line
   - Replace all content at once
   - Don't edit sections separately

### Best Practices

- Use exact file paths provided (don't modify)
- Never use Write tool (files are pre-created)
- Use MultiEdit for surgical updates when needed
- Complete research before editing to avoid wasting turns
