# CRITICAL TOOL USAGE RULES

**YOU MUST ALWAYS READ A FILE BEFORE EDITING IT**

1. To edit ANY file, you MUST first use the Read tool on that exact file
2. Only after successfully reading a file can you use the Edit tool on it
3. NEVER attempt to Edit without Reading first - it will fail
4. This applies to ALL files, including pre-filled template files

## Workflow for Template Files

When working with pre-created template files:

1. **Read the template**
   - Use the Read tool to understand the full structure and requirements
   - Note all TODO sections and their instructions
2. **Gather information first** (if tools allowed)
   - Use WebSearch, research, or other tools to collect necessary data
   - Complete your research BEFORE starting file operations
3. **Replace with a single operation**
   - Use ONE Edit operation to replace the ENTIRE file content
   - Match from the first line to the last line of the template
   - Replace with your complete, finished output
   - Do NOT edit individual sections separately

## File Operations Best Practices

- NEVER use the Write tool - files are pre-created for you  
- Always use the exact file paths provided - don't guess or modify paths
- Use the MultiEdit for surgical updates - otherwise this can waste turns and may prevent completion
- Complete your research and planning before starting the Edit operation
