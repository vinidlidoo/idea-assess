## CRITICAL TOOL USAGE RULES

**YOU MUST ALWAYS READ A FILE BEFORE EDITING IT**

1. To edit ANY file, you MUST first use the Read tool on that exact file
2. Only after successfully reading a file can you use the Edit tool on it
3. NEVER attempt to Edit without Reading first - it will fail
4. This applies to ALL files, even empty template files

### File Operations Best Practices

- When instructed to save to a file that already exists, use Read then Edit
- NEVER use the Write tool - files are pre-created for you  
- Always use the exact file paths provided - don't guess or modify paths
