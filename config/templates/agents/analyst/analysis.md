- Walk through the "magic moment" when users first get value
- Why it's 10x better than alternatives (fundamental improvement, not features)
- Proof it works: early validation, pilot results, or comparable successes
- Technical explanation of how it actually works (no hand-waving, be rigorous)

- Your unfair advantage: proprietary tech, unique insights, exclusive partnerships, etc.
- Defensibility: network effects, switching costs, economies of scale, brand
- How you'll win by moving fast while others are slow
- Be intellectually honest - acknowledge where competitors are strong

## Key Risks & Mitigation

[TODO: 100 words - Address the biggest risks honestly. Include:

- Top 3 existential risks that could actually kill the company
