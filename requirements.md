# Business Idea Evaluator - Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

A CLI-based system that evaluates multiple business ideas using AI agents to analyze market potential, competitive landscape, and various risk factors. The system will leverage Claude SDK and modern Anthropic features to provide comprehensive, evidence-based evaluations with narrative reports and comparative rankings.

## System Overview

### Purpose

Automate the evaluation of 10-15 business ideas simultaneously, providing detailed analysis reports and a comparative summary to identify the most promising opportunities.

### Key Objectives

1. Provide data-driven, narrative-rich evaluations of business ideas
2. Enable systematic comparison across multiple ideas
3. Leverage latest Claude SDK and agent capabilities
4. Maintain version control of all analyses via git

## Functional Requirements

### P0 - Initial Prototype

#### Input Management

- **Initial Input**: One or two-line business idea description (e.g., "AI-powered fitness coaching app" or "Sustainable packaging for e-commerce using mushroom materials")
- **Ideas File**: Store pending ideas in `ideas/pending.txt` (one per line)
- **Scale**: Support 10-15 active ideas
- **Naming Convention**: Ideas converted to slugs (e.g., "ai-fitness-coach", "mushroom-packaging")

#### Generated Analysis Document

- **Format**: Structured markdown with enforced template (~1000 words)
- **Required Sections** (generated by Analyst agent):
  - Problem Statement
  - Solution Description
  - Target Market
  - Business Model
  - Go-to-Market Strategy
  - Capital Requirements
  - Technology Requirements
  - Skills Requirements
- **Word Limits**: Enforce per-section constraints for clarity
- **Supplemental Documents**: Free-form markdown for additional data/research

#### Evaluation Framework

- **Evaluation Criteria** (each scored A-D):
  1. Market Potential (TAM, growth rate, trends)
  2. Competitive Landscape (competitors, barriers, disruption potential)
  3. Technical Feasibility (complexity, readiness, timeline)
  4. Capital Requirements (initial investment, burn rate, profitability path)
  5. Regulatory Risks (compliance, legal barriers, licensing)
  6. Execution Difficulty (operations, supply chain, distribution)
  7. Evidence Quality (strength of supporting data/citations)

#### Processing Pipeline

- **Sequential Processing**: One idea at a time
- **Agent Architecture** (clear separation of responsibilities):
  - **Analyst Agent**: Takes one-liner input, conducts research, creates full analysis document
  - **Reviewer Agent**: Provides feedback to improve analysis quality
  - **Judge Agent**: Assigns evaluation grades based on completed analysis
  - **Synthesizer Agent**: Generates comparative summary report across all graded ideas
- **Data Sources**: Combined web search/scraping + LLM reasoning
- **Model Selection**: Bias toward higher compute (Opus/Sonnet) for quality

#### Output Requirements

- **Per-Idea Outputs**:
  - Analysis document: `analyses/{idea-slug}/analysis.md`
  - Evaluation grades: `analyses/{idea-slug}/evaluation.json`
  - Supporting research: `analyses/{idea-slug}/research.md`
- **Summary Report**: `reports/summary-{timestamp}.md`
  - Ranked table of all ideas with grades
  - Comparative narrative analysis
  - Clear rationale for rankings
  - Top 3 recommendations with justification
- **Version Control**: Git-based tracking of all analyses and reports

#### CLI Interface

- Commands:
  - `analyze "<idea-description>"` - Convert one-liner into full analysis
  - `analyze <idea-slug>` - Re-analyze existing idea
  - `analyze --all` - Analyze all ideas in pending.txt
  - `grade <idea-slug>` - Grade an existing analysis
  - `grade --all` - Grade all analyzed ideas
  - `generate-summary` - Create comparative report (requires 2+ graded ideas)

### P1 - Future Enhancements

#### Advanced Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Batch evaluation of multiple ideas
- **Weighted Scoring**: Configurable weights for evaluation criteria
- **Re-evaluation**: Update analyses when market conditions change
- **External APIs**: Integration with market research databases, patent searches
- **Idea Generation**: Module to create new ideas from external sources
- **Team Fit Analysis**: Additional criterion for founder/team alignment

#### Enhanced Templates

- **Structured Supplemental Docs**: Define format for appendices

#### Additional Outputs

- CSV export capabilities
- Dashboard visualization
- API endpoints for programmatic access

## Technical Requirements

### Initial Implementation (P0)

- **Framework**: Python-based CLI using Claude SDK
- **Agent Orchestration**: Simple coordinator pattern
- **Tool Integration**: All non-native tools accessed via MCP protocol
- **Storage**: File-based (markdown) with git versioning
- **Dependencies**:
  - Claude SDK (latest)
  - MCP-compatible tools for web scraping and search
  - Git for version control

### Future Architecture (P1)

- **Architecture**: Evolve to parallel pipeline
- **Orchestration**: Complex workflow engine
- **Web Interface**: Optional web UI

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- **P0**: Sequential processing acceptable (minutes per idea)
- **P1**: Parallel processing for sub-minute evaluations

### Reliability

- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry (3x) for failed API calls
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with LLM knowledge if web search fails
- **Checkpoint/Resume**: Save progress after each agent completes
- **Validation**: Verify required sections exist before grading
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent edits via git merge strategies

### Security & Compliance

- Respect robots.txt for web scraping
- Rate limiting for API calls

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully evaluate 10+ ideas with consistent quality
2. Generate actionable insights with evidence-based reasoning
3. Provide clear comparative rankings with justification
4. Demonstrate effective use of Claude SDK agent capabilities
5. Maintain reproducible results via git versioning

## Learning Goals

- Master Claude SDK agent patterns
- Implement effective agent coordination
- Leverage hooks and slash commands
- Explore sub-agent architectures
- Build production-ready CLI tools

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)

- Set up project structure and Claude SDK
- Configure MCP tools for web scraping
- Create basic CLI framework
- Implement idea input and storage

### Phase 2: Core Agents (Days 4-7)

- Build Analyst agent to expand one-liners into full documents
- Implement Reviewer feedback loop
- Create Judge evaluation logic
- Test agent pipeline end-to-end

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish (Days 8-10)

- Connect full agent pipeline
- Build Synthesizer agent for comparative analysis
- Implement git versioning with auto-commit after each stage
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Write usage documentation and examples

## Constraints & Assumptions

- Claude Max plan (5x capacity) available
- Ideas provided as input (not generated)
- English-language analysis only
- Focus on software/tech business ideas initially
- Single user/local execution (no concurrency concerns)
- Internet connectivity required for web search
